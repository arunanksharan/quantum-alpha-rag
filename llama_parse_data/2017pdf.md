## Global Economy

Sluggish growth in 2016

The world economic growth rate remained subdued at 3.1% in 2016. This was largely due to the turbulences in the world markets during the first half of the year. Brexit, China’s slowdown, low oil prices and overall economic weakness in Japan, the US and Europe were primarily responsible for slow economic growth.

Moreover, the recovery of global economy was weighed down by spillover effects of Brexit and uncertain trade policies of the new White House regime; both of which led to unpredictable policies cautioning investors. Besides, the tightening purse of the US Federal Reserve dampened private investments further hurting global growth prospects.

Meanwhile, in the advanced economies, these setbacks were offset by ‘stronger than expected’ economic activities during the second half of 2016. This was clearly visible in the US, displaying a decelerated unemployment rate; and in the UK which witnessed a rise in domestic demand following Brexit. These higher than expected changes in advanced economies set in motion a growth trend. If this trend continues, the world economy is expected to pick up steam in 2017 and grow by 3.4%.

### USA:

The projected growth for the US economy has been revised upward by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). This reflects the assumed fiscal policy easing and an upswing in confidence, especially after the Presidential elections. If such a scenario persists, it will reinforce the cyclical momentum. There is however, pervasive uncertainty around policy shifts.

### Euro Zone:

Clouded by Brexit and slowdown in major economies of the region, such as Germany, Spain and Italy, the Eurozone’s economic performance is expected to remain

Going forward, the Company has committed an investment of ` 2,800 Crores over the period of next five years.

Indian Economy

India continues to be one of the fastest growing major economies in the world, reporting a robust GDP growth of 7.1% in FY 2016-17. Government’s bold measures on many fronts are helping India reach its true potential. India’s fundamental economic indicators - inflation, fiscal deficit, and current account deficit – showed reduction. India’s FDI inflows stood at a record USD 60.1 billion in FY 2016-17.

Inflation: The retail inflation stayed above 5% till August 2016. However, it started moderating thereafter due to a good monsoon, dropping to a two-year low of 3.4%. The average inflation for the FY 2016-17 stood at 4.5% vis-à-vis 4.9% in FY 2015-16.

Year FY 2016-17 witnessed major reforms by the Indian Government amongst which were:

- Demonetisation: In FY 2016-17, the Government announced demonetisation of high denomination currency notes. The decision was aimed at curbing corruption, counterfeiting terrorist activities and accumulation of black money. With demonetisation, the economy was introduced to various long-term benefits like greater digitalisation of the economy and ensuring formalisation of it. Besides, the process strove to increase flow of financial savings into the banking system. Further, it is expected that in the long run, demonetisation may lead to a higher GDP growth. Additionally, it envisages better tax compliance and greater tax revenues by reducing corruption. Demonetisation led to a temporary demand compression across industries and retail trade was affected in the months of November, December and January. Demand started to pick up from February onwards.
- Goods and Services Tax: Goods and Services Tax (GST) is a single comprehensive tax levied on all goods and services consumed in the country. It is considered as India’s most important tax reform post-independence. The introduction of Goods and Service Tax is a significant step in the reform of indirect taxation and will convert India into an integrated unified market. Amalgamation of several central and state taxes into a single tax would mitigate cascading or double taxation and facilitate a simplicity of tax and easier administration. GST to be implemented from July 1, 2017 is expected to lead India’s economy into an era of growth, greater competitiveness and transparency while simultaneously widening the country’s tax net. It is expected to contribute significantly to the GDP growth in the long run. However, making projections and targets for GST revenue in its first year of implementation would be difficult. The Company believes that GST will help bolster India’s economic progress in the long run.
- BS IV norms: The Supreme Court banned the sale of Bharat Stage III (BS III) vehicles with effect from April 1, 2017 in a ruling given on March 29, 2017. It came as a setback to various automobile manufacturers who contended that the

\*Bharat stage standards are emission standards instituted by the Government of India to check the air pollution due to emissions from internal combustion engine equipment.

## CORPORATE OVERVIEW

31st March deadline was only meant for production of such vehicles but their sale could continue. As per Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), there was an inventory of more eight lakh BS III vehicles when the ruling was passed. The OEM sale in commercial and two/three vehicle categories in the first few months of the current fiscal year is expected to go down due to the inability of the OEM manufacturers to quickly ramp up to produce BS IV compliant vehicles. The situation is likely to normalize going forward.

## FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Outlook for India’s economy

India’s GDP growth rate is expected to reach 7.4% in FY 2017-18, driven by a rebound in consumption demand, which had dampened post demonetization. Further, the consumption growth will be stimulated by a normal monsoon, benign inflation, and softer interest rates. An expected normal monsoon in 2017 will ensure that agricultural income continues to rise. Interest rates are likely to reduce further due to policy rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of India (Source: CRISIL).

During the last seven years, the tyre industry has grown at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 4.5%. In 2016, the global tyre market produced more than 2.9 billion units (Source: Business Wire).

The growth of the global tyre industry is driven by rising income levels, increased urbanisation, and fast economic growth in the developing countries. Rise in disposable incomes leading to increased purchasing power of consumers, worldwide, has significantly propelled the demand of automobiles and tyres globally.

As countries seek to address energy efficiency issues and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, development in sustainable and green mobility have become a global agenda. Electric vehicles, in particular, offer a spectrum of opportunities to reduce emission, increase energy security and improving fuel efficiency. About 1.3 million electric vehicles were sold worldwide in 2016, registering a growth of 76% on YoY basis (Source: ATMA).

#### US tyre market:

USA’s automobile market is the second largest automobile market in the world. Increasing disposable income due to strengthening US Dollar, falling oil and food prices and rising standard of living are resulting in an increase in production and vehicle sales in the US. Steady growth in sales and production of automobiles, expanding automobile fleet and favourable government policies are anticipated to propel growth in the US tyre market over the next five years (Source: Business Wire).

#### Chinese tyre market:

Currently, China is the world’s largest market for tyres. The Chinese automobile industry has grown at a tremendous pace. It has catalyzed the development of the country’s tyre sector, both in terms of production as well as consumption. The operating rate of the Chinese market rebounded significantly in 2016, showing an uptrend in the off-season after October. In 2016, export value of China was USD 12.89 billion, down by 6.9% on YoY basis. The value of tyres exported from China to the US was USD 2.1 billion, accounting for 16.3% of China’s total export value of tyres in the same duration. Due to anti-dumping and countervailing duty imposed by the US administration, Chinese imports in Truck and Bus categories suffered a setback and fell below USD 1 billion in the first eleven months of 2016. However, these duties were rolled back in February 2017. The UK was the second largest market for Chinese exports. In 2016, the value of tyres exported from China to the UK was USD 0.54 billion, accounting for 4.2% of China’s total export value of tyres.

#### European tyre market:

## Europe continues to be the epicenter of all major global advancements in tyre technology. The European tyre market is predicted to grow at a CAGR of 5% during 2014-2019. All the three zones - Western, Central and Eastern Europe are expected to contribute to this growth. Tyre categories especially Passenger Cars (PC), Light Commercial Vehicles (LCV) and Medium and Heavy Commercial Vehicles (M&HCV) will witness most of this growth. Germany, the UK, France, Italy, Spain and Poland are the major markets that contribute to more than 60% of the total Europe tyre sales in volume terms. By 2020, passenger cars and light commercial vehicle sales are likely to reach about 16.9 million units in Western Europe, about 3.7 million units in Central Europe and 4.6 million units in Eastern Europe. Passenger vehicle is the dominant segment in European tyre market. Moreover, it is forecasted.

## MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Increasing tyre radialisation, growing demand for Chinese tyres and proliferation of the used car market is anticipated to drive demand for tyres in Africa further during 2016-2022. The developing countries of Africa, the Middle-East and Central and South Americas are likely to register average growth in tyre sales with growth rates of below six percent.

Outlook For Global Tyre Industry

Asia-Pacific, which accounts for more than 50% of global sale is likely to grow the fastest through 2019. In 2014, China alone consumed one-fourth of the total tyres produced globally. China is expected to remain one of the fastest growing markets for tyres, in the years to come. Additionally, other countries in the region like India, Indonesia, and Thailand are also projected to witness an increased demand for tyres. Japan has the world’s fourth largest market for tyres. However, over the forecast period through 2019, it is expected to post disappointing sales and experience a contraction in demand for tyres.

The developing countries of Africa, the Middle-East and Central and South Americas are likely to register average growth in tyre sales with growth rates of below six percent.

Further, tyre demand in North America and Western Europe will record meagre increase of about 1% annually through 2019. Low demand for tyres in advanced economies is disappointing as they have matured replacement tyre markets with high rates of vehicle ownership (Source: Freedonia).

### Indian Tyre Industry

Key trends shaping India’s tyre industry
Budding market for electric cars due to focus on sustainability of pe environment
Definitive trend in OEMs seeking low rolling resistance tyres for higher fuel efficiency
Rising share of higher inch (15+) tyres in four-wheeler categories
High growp potential across tyre segments due to increasing income levels, urbanisation, economic growp and favourable monsoon

Overview

Revenue for India’s tyre industry stood at ₹530 billion in FY 2015-16. It caters to Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM), Export and Replacement markets through four broad vehicle categories: Commercial Vehicle (CV), Passenger Vehicles (PV), Two-Wheeler and others including Tractors and Off Highway Tyre (OHT). Indian tyre industry has sufficient capacity to meet the needs of the country’s tyre requirements.

### Industry segmentation

Based on Vehicle Category: The Indian tyre industry can be segmented into four broad categories based on the tyres produced for various types of vehicles. In terms of volume, two and three-wheelers tyres account for more than half of production but contribute only 13% of the industry revenues. In contrast, the Truck and Bus tyre segment contributes approximately 13% to the total tyre production, but has the highest revenue share of the industry at 54%. Passenger cars segment at 14%, in terms of revenue, has the second highest share in tyre production in India. This segment is showing an increasing trend both in numbers and revenue. Tractor and Light Commercial Vehicle (LCV) segments’ total volume share stands at approximately 9 %, while its revenue share stands at about 17%.

| Vehicle Category          | RADIALISATION (%) |
| ------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Passenger cars            | 98                |
| Light Commercial Vehicles | 40                |
| Heavy Commercial Vehicles | 37                |

Based on Technology: Tyres are classified as cross-ply (bias) and radial based on the technology deployed during its manufacturing. In India, the commercial tyre segment continues to be dominated by cross-ply tyres due to road conditions, loading patterns and the high initial cost of radials. Currently, radialisation is highest in passenger cars (98%) followed by light commercial vehicles (40%) and heavy commercial vehicles (37%).

Based on Market: India’s tyre industry sells to three distinct markets, namely, Replacement, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) and Exports. By value, replacement accounts for nearly 60% of market and OEM and exports makes up the rest. The major reason for high replacement share is due

Source: Industry estimates

India’s tyre industry revenues grew at a steady CAGR of 8% from FY 2010-11 to FY 2015-16. However, revenue growth as well as profit growth was adversely affected in FY 2016-17 due to demand compression because of factors, such as demonetisation and subdued realisation due to spike in raw material prices. Chinese imports continue to pose a threat to India’s tyre industry across categories. Chinese imports in India have grown by more than 350% since FY 2012-13 against the overall import growth rate of 129%. Value of Chinese imports stood at ` 16.9 billion in FY 2016-17. Chinese imports continued to rise at alarming rate for the first eight months of the current fiscal year. Demonetisation, though, brought down the unorganised segment’s import of Chinese tyres, thereby limiting their share in last four months of the year. Nevertheless, demand in two-wheeler, passenger and tractor segments were adversely affected due to demonetisation. With the spike in raw material prices and falling realisations, industry margins witnessed contraction.

| India’s tyre export has increased at a steady rate of 6% in the last 10 years. However, year 2016 witnessed a muted growth of about 1%. In volume terms, two-wheeler tyres registered the fastest growth of 17%, followed by passenger vehicle tyres (13%) and truck and bus tyres (12%). | Total tyres imported in India declined by 3% in FY 2016-17 on YoY basis. Following demonetisation, the last four months of the year 2016-17 witnessed significant declines in total tyre import. |

## 2011

Exports to top 10 countries represent nearly half of the tyre exports from India, with USA, Germany and UAE absorbing about 25% of exports (in value terms). Exports grew at sharp rate in most of the key destinations, barring Brazil and Pakistan.

India does not have any Foreign Trade Agreements (FTAs)/Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs) with top economies like USA and EU countries that could provide concessions on tariffs for its exported tyres. Tyre industry is largely dependent on natural rubber, synthetic rubber and crude derivatives that are largely imported and heavily taxed, which reduces exports competitiveness of the industry. Also, natural rubber falls under negative list of all FTAs/RTAs except Sri Lanka, which impacts the competitiveness of India’s tyre industry.

Overall, the industry grew by 6.9% on YoY basis with impressive growth in scooters (11%).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |      |            |      |
| Commercial Vehicles:            | The domestic Commercial Vehicle (CV) industry ended the FY 2016-17 with a growth of 4.2% in volume terms largely driven by recovery in the Light Commercial Vehicle segment, which registered a growth of 7.4% in FY 2016-17 on YoY basis. In contrast, the M&HCV (Truck) segment reported flat sales during the year on account of a) weak replacement-led demand, b) subdued freight demand from industrial segments, due to demonetisation and c) lower than expected pre-buying (ahead of the implementation of BS-IV emission norms), despite high discounts being offered by the industry. During the year, the bus segment, which contributes 14% to industry sales, witnessed a growth of 5.7% in volume sales driven by stable demand from almost all segments. |      |            |      |
| Tractors:                       | As a result of good monsoon, tractor recorded the highest volume growth of 20% during FY 2016-17. The second half of FY 2016-17 was particularly good for the industry recording a growth rate of above 30%. In March 2017, leading tractor OEMs reported robust double-digit growths in domestic volumes, thereby pointing to continuation of growth momentum in the industry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |      |            |      |

|                    | (a) Natural Rubber (NR): At present, domestic Natural Rubber (NR) prices are trading at `150/kg after breaking out from the three-year high level of `160/kg in February 2017. NR prices were on a rise due to global factors like reduced supply from Thailand due to heavy rains and floods, increase in consumption in China and the US and higher crude oil prices. Between November 2016 and January 2017, NR prices had sharply jumped in both domestic and global markets by around 30% and 50%, respectively. However, NR prices have corrected since the last week of February 2017 with rising production and falling crude oil prices. A major factor that contributed to this was the government of Thailand’s decision to liquidate its large NR stockpile to cash in on the elevated NR prices (Source: ICRA research). |         |         |         |         |         |
|                    | (b) Synthetic Rubber (SR): Synthetic Rubber prices draw cues from price movement of oil and butadiene (a key raw material), apart from the fundamental demand and supply gap. In FY 2016-17, the SR prices witnessed an uptrend due to tight supply of feedstock-butadiene owing to maintenance-led shutdown of large crackers in the Asian and European markets. Further, strong demand from the Chinese domestic auto market, which drove demand for SR in 2016 is expected to ease, as tax break on car purchases in China get reduced in 2017. With annual demand of about 5.5-5.8 lakh tonnes per year, against significantly lower domestic supply, India’s dependence on SR imports remains high (Source: ICRA research).                                                                                                      |         |         |         |         |         |
|                    | (c) Other raw materials: Prices of Carbon Black (CB) and Caprolactum (feedstock for Nylon Tyre Chord Fabric (NTCF)) have followed crude prices, correcting in March 2017. Apart from short-term supply constraints due to plant shutdowns, prices of these derivatives are expected to move in line with crude, going forward.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |         |         |         |         |         |

|                    | Going forward, the domestic tyre demand over the near to medium term is expected to remain stable. It will be supported by favourable tyre demand, both domestic and exports, and likely to bring in improvement in realization. The expected revenue growth for the industry is projected between 12% and 13% (CAGR) during 2017-2020. (Source: ICRA research). However, the industry’s profit margins are expected to contract with higher pressures of capacity utilization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |         |         |         |         |         |

## MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Tyre exports are projected to grow at 6%-8% over next three years, led by stable demand and increased acceptance of Indian tyres in overseas markets, both in terms of quality and pricing. However, with rising penetration of low-cost Chinese tyres in overseas markets, competition from China (both in terms of volumes and pricing) will remain a challenge (Source: ICRA research).

Opportunities and Challenges

Opportunities for tyre industry in India

Rising economic development in India, presents tyre industry with many opportunities to grow, as listed below:

| (a) Penetration level of passenger cars                    | Passenger car penetration levels in India currently are at very nascent stages vis-à-vis other emerging and developed countries (India has only 10 cars per 1000 population in comparison to the world average of 125). India is expected to continue on its current high-growth path, and over the next two decades, the average household income is expected to rise by about 200%. The emergence of a young and aspirational middle class will drive passenger vehicle industry, which will subsequently fuel growth of the tyre industry.                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| (b) Faster economic growth                                 | India is among the fastest growing economies in the world and it is witnessing steadfast economic activities in various sectors. Infrastructure development, construction and housing sector are among the key areas of focus for the Government of India (GoI). The GoI has formulated various policies and provided several incentives to drive these sectors. In addition, “Make in India” programme will attract investment in the manufacturing sector and spur higher industrial activities. All this will result in greater demand for industrial and construction tyres.                                                                               |
| (c) Increased radialisation trend in commercial categories | While passenger vehicles are almost fully radialised (about 98%), India is currently witnessing rapid radialisation in commercial categories too. Currently, around 37% vehicles in truck and bus (T&B) segment and 40% in light commercial vehicles (LCV) have been radialised. Backed by growing awareness of cost benefits, continuously improving road infrastructure, stringent implementation of overloading norms and new radial capacities going onstream, radialisation levels in the commercial vehicle space are likely to reach to 65-70% over the next few years, which is expected to yield significant benefits for this industry moving ahead. |

## Corporate Overview

Challenges for tyre industry in India

Tyre industry in India, as discussed above, has several opportunities to grow, however, it still has long way to go to compete in the global marketplace.

- Greater import dependence of raw materials and inverted duty structure
  Tyre industry is raw material intensive. Raw materials account for nearly 65-70% of the total production cost. Natural rubber is the primary raw material in the production process of tyres and results in 44% of total raw material cost. However, Indian tyre industry has to depend upon imported natural rubber due to mismatch in production and consumption of domestic natural rubber. Inverted duty structure is a key challenge for India’s tyre industry. Inverted duty structure leads to natural rubber attracting significantly higher customs duty (25%) than in its finished product (10%). India is the only country that has inverted duty structure for tyre industry. It reduces competitiveness of domestic industry and encourages volumes of cheap imported tyres, despite adequate domestic capacity already in place.
- Volatility in raw material prices
  Natural rubber and crude oil prices are volatile and controlled by external environment. China in the second half of the year increased the production of tyres, which had a significant impact on global raw material prices. Natural Rubber prices increased to ₹136/kg in FY 2016-17 compared to ₹113/kg in FY 2015-16. It reached a peak of ₹160/kg in the month of February 2017. Volatility in raw material prices impact the profitability of the industry.
- Tyre imports from China
  Chinese imports continue to pose a threat to India’s tyre industry across categories. Manufacturers are worried about the rampant dumping of Chinese tyres in India, which are available in substantially lower prices.

### Business Review

CEAT, a flagship company of the RPG Group, is among the leading tyre manufacturers, offering best-in-class tyres across categories. CEAT is one of the fastest growing Indian tyre company with a CAGR of 11% in its net sales from FY 2008-09. CEAT’s market capitalisation has increased by more than 20 times in last 5 (five) years and it has given highest returns to its shareholders in the Indian tyre industry in last 5 (five) years.

CEAT aims to achieve leadership position in passenger vehicle space in coming years, especially in two-wheelers tyre. In the last few years, CEAT has been able to grow much faster than the industry in this segment. In the last 5 (five) years, CEAT’s revenue in two-three wheeler tyres category and passenger and utility vehicle category has grown at a CAGR 26% and 21%, respectively.

CEAT sells in three segments: Replacement, OEM and Exports. 64% of CEAT’s revenue come from Replacement, followed by OEM and Exports which bring in 24% and 12% revenues respectively.

The Company has manufacturing facilities at Bhandup, Nashik, Halol and Nagpur. CEAT meets close to two-thirds of its production through in-house plants and secures the rest from various outsourcing partners on conversion cost basis and bought-out basis. It operates in Sri Lanka through a 50:50 JV, named CEAT Kelani Holdings Company (Private) Limited. CEAT, through its subsidiary has initiated construction of an Off-Highway Tyre plant at Ambernath, Maharashtra.

The Company enjoys a market share of 12% in India’s tyre market and manufactures more than 95,000 tyres per day. CEAT has invested heavily in the development of a state of the art R&D centre at Halol to enable a funnel of innovative new products.

\*India consumed more than 10 lacs tons of natural rubber in FY 2016-17, while the production was less than seven lacs tons, thus India needing to import about 3.5 lacs tons from the global market.

New products developed

Last few years have seen a healthy roll-out of new innovative products across categories. Today, more than 20% of our revenue comes from new products.

CEAT has always focused upon making its manufacturing facilities highly efficient and flexible supported by an empowered and engaged work force. To achieve this, CEAT uses Total Quality Management (TQM) approach of planning and executing operational excellence. CEAT is committed to improving parameters on Quality, Cost, Delivery, Safety and Morale (QCDSM) in its manufacturing units.

## MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Further, CEAT’s Nagpur plant is being planned on the lines of a 'Smart' plant. This is the first two-wheeler tyre manufacturing plant that has conceptualized digitalization in India. This would not only result in efficiency improvements and better yields but also enable online access of all performance matrices. Mistake proofing, Auto Safety Interlocks, Centralized Recipe Management, and Warehouse Management are also a part of this project. The project would also provide a much-needed fillip to the employees on the shop floor and reduce manual interventions drastically. This will be the stepping stone towards the journey of artificial intelligence, where machines improve the quality of products to be delivered based on algorithms.

Risk Management

CEAT is aware that a thorough risk management system is necessary in the face of evolving risks propelled by market volatilities and other external factors. Thus, it has in place a robust Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) architecture. The primary objective of the ERM framework is to help in identifying risk and mitigating them at various levels.

Process of risk management

The risk management process at CEAT begins with identification of risks and assessment of their impact. The assessment is based on past trends and events. Later, ways to mitigate these risks are identified and implemented when necessary. Risks, once identified, are periodically monitored along with emerging risks.

Risks and their mitigation

Disruption in supply of key raw material

Disruption in supply of key raw material and high conversion cost may impact the cost of production leading to lower margins.

Competition

Rising competition from domestic players and Chinese imports impacting profitability. The Company is insistent about its channel expansion, enhanced after-sales services, and superior quality of products and warranty offered on them. CEAT’s superior domain knowledge along with technology prowess, branding, and reach are helping it challenge both domestic and foreign players. Moreover, it has long-standing relations with original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) who trust the Company, which helps it cut through the competition. The Company is focusing on the sale of a profitable segment, developing capacities for new product development, and entering new markets under the premium segment to increase market share.

Radialisation in Trucks and Bus Segments

Increase in the truck and bus tyre segment radialization may impact volume. The Company is converting its truck and bus bias capacities into non-truck segments that have higher demand. The focus is also on penetrating the overseas markets to fully utilize its bias capacity.

Commodity Price Volatility

Fluctuating Raw Material Prices can affect profit margins considerably. The Company has been strengthening supplier relations to build mutually beneficial long-term associations. Besides, the Company continues to explore a wider supplier base to reduce dependency on the current one.

Reduction of shares in export sales

Challenges to meet the target of export sale may impact capacity utilization of plants. The Company endeavors to increase the market share in existing and new markets by improving export sales across geographies with a better product portfolio.

Environment, Occupational Health And Safety

CEAT works towards creating a safe working environment for all its assets. It is committed to reducing accidents at work and occupational illnesses; and thereby, follows a proactive and systematic approach to identify hazards and risks.

## STATUTORY REPORTS

## DISCUSSION ON FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

The long term rating of the Company improved from ‘AA-‘to ‘AA’. During the year, the average borrowings reduced on account
of better profitability, effective use of working capital and prepayment of some of the high interest bearing loans. The Company
prepaid the high cost loans using internal accruals to refinance these loans bearing higher interest rates. The funding for projects
was also met through internal accruals and low cost borrowings. The Company increased the frequency and amount of pre-
shipment credit in foreign currency during the year as compared to previous year, being the cheaper source of short term funding.
The Company took conscious steps to shift from high cost borrowings to low cost borrowings. The lower interest rates, negotiation
of finance charges and improved credit rating of the Company reduced the borrowing cost for the Company on the overall level.

Also there has been a huge reduction in premium paid for raw material buyer’s credit as company has reduced the exposure of raw
material buyer’s credit, thereby reducing other finance charges substantially.

## CORPORATE OVERVIEW

Total other expenses as a percentage of sales have gone up to 20.25% in the current year from 19.78% in the previous year. Conversion charges represent the charges paid to various outsourcing vendors working on a job work basis i.e. converting the raw material to tyres. The increase in conversion cost during the year was on account of an increase in outsourced volume.

Increase in power and fuel is an outcome of an increase in tariff and higher consumption of power and fuel oil. The consumption has substantially increased due to the commissioning of Nagpur and Halol projects.

Due to an increase in diesel prices, there has been an increase in freight cost which has been partly neutralized through better utilization of truck capacity.

The Company has been consciously focusing on enhancing the brand equity through effective marketing. This has been witnessed by the innovative ad campaigns, continued association with IPL (CEAT Strategic Timeout), association with emerging cricketers like Ajinkya Rahane and continuing with players like Rohit Sharma and Suresh Raina for promoting CEAT logo onto their bats, etc which resulted in increased advertisement and marketing expenditure.

Training and conference expenses have increased on account of international training for senior employees. Also, as the Company is aiming for the Deming award due to which trainings in QBM practice are being provided to employees.

For details on CSR expenses refer note 36 of financials and for CSR activities please refer to a separate section in the annual report.

## INDUSTRY UPDATE

The calendar year 2016 was a challenging one for the world economy. Weak international trade and subdued investment slowed world growth to its weakest pace since 2009. Economic activity is projected to pick up in 2017 and 2018, especially in emerging markets. Even though the outlook is brighter this year, heightened uncertainty about policy direction in major economies casts a shadow over the prospects of recovery.

Amid this challenging environment, India has emerged amongst the fastest growing major economies in the world. The Indian economy was expected to grow by more than 7.75% in FY 2016-17, supported by strong government reforms, the Reserve Bank of India’s inflation focus and benign global commodity prices. However, the second half of FY 2016-17 witnessed a slowdown in growth primarily due to the demonetization impact and a sharp rise in commodity prices.

During FY 2016-17, overall sales growth remained buoyant for the Indian Automobile industry with growth across all categories except Medium & Heavy Commercial vehicles. However, exports continued to remain a cause of concern, predominantly in the two-wheeler segment. The domestic vehicle sales grew by 7.4%, while exports showed a negative growth of 7%. Domestic Passenger vehicles and two-wheelers grew by 9.16% and 7.54% respectively. The automotive industry production which grew by 8% during FY 2014-15, decelerated to 2.3% in FY 2015-16. However, structural tailwinds point to sustenance of this trend and an annual production growth of about 7% during FY 2016-17.

The domestic tyre industry was helped by the fall in input costs in the first half specially Natural Rubber prices which fell by 15% during 2016 and crude which was on a downward spiral in 2016. This led to some margin expansion in the first half of 2017. Growth in demand from the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) and the replacement market resulted in a positive growth in FY 2016-17 over the previous year. However, the revenues of the tyre industry was affected by unabated flow of cheap Chinese tyres in the country.

Annexure 2 to the Independent Auditor’s Report of even date on the Standalone Financial Statements of Ceat Limited

Report on the Internal Financial Controls under internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing the Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)

We have audited the internal financial controls over financial reporting of CEAT Limited (“the Company”) as of March 31, 2017 in conjunction with our audit of the standalone financial statements of the Company for the year ended on that date.

Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls

The Company’s Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the Company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013.

Auditor’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) and the Standards on Auditing as specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls and, both issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls system over financial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal financial controls system over financial reporting.

Meaning of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal financial control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting

Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control over financial reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

## CEAT LIMITED

Opinion

In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system over financial reporting and such internal financial controls over financial reporting were operating effectively as at March 31, 2017 based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.

  |1. Basis of accounting and preparation of financial statements|3. Revenue recognition|
  |The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) notified under the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015. For all periods up to and including the year ended March 31, 2016, the Company prepared its financial statements in accordance with the accounting standards notified under the section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, read together with paragraph 7 of the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014 (Indian GAAP). These financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2017 are the first financial statements which the Company has prepared in accordance with Ind AS. Refer to note 51 for information on how the Company adopted Ind AS. These financial statements have been prepared on accrual basis and under historical cost basis, except for the following assets and liabilities which have been measured at fair value: - Derivative financial instruments
- Certain financial assets measured at fair value (refer accounting policy regarding financial instruments)
  In addition, the carrying values of recognized assets and liabilities designated as hedged items in fair value hedges that would otherwise be carried at amortized cost are adjusted to record changes in the fair values attributable to the risks that are being hedged in effective hedge relationships. The Standalone financial statements are presented in ` except when otherwise indicated.|Revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Company and the revenue can be reliably measured, regardless of when the payment is being made. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, taking into account contractually defined terms of payment and excluding taxes or duties collected on behalf of the government. The Company has concluded that it is the principal in all of its revenue arrangements since it is the primary obligor in all the revenue arrangements as it has pricing latitude and is also exposed to inventory and credit risks. Based on the educational material on Ind AS 18 issued by the ICAI, the Group has assumed that recovery of excise duty flows to the company on its own account.

## FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## for the year ended March 31, 2017

1. Revenue Recognition

Revenue from the sale of goods (i.e. tyres, tubes and flaps) is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer. Revenue from the sale of tyres, tubes and flaps is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns and allowances, trade discounts, volume rebates, cash discounts, sales taxes and Value Added Taxes. The Company provides normal warranty provisions for a period of three years on all its products sold, in line with the industry practice. A liability is recognised at the time the product is sold – see Note 22 for more information. The Company does not provide any extended warranties to its customers.

2. Interest Income

For all debt instruments measured either at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income, interest income is recorded using the effective interest rate (EIR). EIR is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts over the expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate, to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset or to the amortised cost of a financial liability. When calculating the effective interest rate, the Company estimates the expected cash flows by considering all the contractual terms of the financial instrument (for example, prepayment, extension, call and similar options) but does not consider the expected credit losses. Interest income is included in finance income in the statement of profit and loss.

3. Dividends

Revenue is recognised when the Company’s right to receive the payment is established, which is generally when shareholders approve the dividend.

4. Government grants and Export incentives

Government grants are recognised where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all attached conditions will be complied with. When the grant relates to an expense item, it is recognised as income on a systematic basis over the periods that the related costs, for which it is intended to compensate, are expensed. When the grant relates to an asset, it is recognised as income in equal amounts over the expected useful life of the related asset. Export Incentives such as Focus Market Scheme, Focus Products Scheme and Special Focus Market Scheme are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss as a part of other operating revenues.

5. Taxes

Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted, at the reporting date in India where the Company operates and generates taxable income. Current income tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss (either in other comprehensive income or in equity). Current tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in statement of profit and loss or directly in equity. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate.

6. Royalty and technology development fees

## Royalty and technology development fees income are accounted for as per the terms of contract.

## CORPORATE OVERVIEW

## STATUTORY REPORTS

## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## for the year ended March 31, 2017

Deferred tax

Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes at the reporting date.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except:

- When the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss
- In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, when the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future

Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss (either in other comprehensive income or in equity). Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity.

Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.

Sales/ value added taxes paid on acquisition of assets or on incurring expenses

Expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales/ value added taxes paid, except:

- When the tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case, the tax paid is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item, as applicable
- When receivables and payables are stated with the amount of tax included

Non-current assets held for sale

The Company classifies non-current assets and disposal groups as held for sale/ distribution to owners if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale/ distribution rather than through continuing use. Actions required for completing the sale/ distribution should indicate that it is unlikely that significant change to the sale/ distribution will be made or that the decision to sell/ distribute will be withdrawn. Management must be committed to the sale/ distribution expected within one year from the date of classification.

Non-current assets held for sale/for distribution to owners and disposal groups are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and the fair value less costs to sell/ distribute. Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale/ distribution are presented separately in the balance sheet.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are re-assessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.

## for the year ended March 31, 2017

7. Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Capital work in progress is stated at cost. Cost comprises the purchase price and any attributable cost of bringing asset to its working condition for its intended use only. Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of the plant and equipment and borrowing costs for long-term construction projects if the recognition criteria are met. Subsequent expenditure related to an item of fixed asset is added to its book value only if it increases the future benefits from the existing asset beyond its previously assessed standard of performance. When significant parts of plant and equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the Company depreciates them separately based on their specific useful lives. Likewise, when a major inspection is performed, its cost is recognised in the carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied. All other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. The present value of the expected cost for the decommissioning of an asset after its use is included in the cost of the respective asset if the recognition criteria for a provision are met. Refer to note 40 regarding significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions for further information about the recorded decommissioning provision.

Leasehold land – amortised on a straight line basis over the period of the lease ranging from 95 years – 99 years.

Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis using the rates arrived at based on the useful lives estimated by the management. The Company has used the following useful lives to provide depreciation on its fixed assets. The identified components are depreciated over their useful lives, the remaining asset is depreciated over the life of the principal asset.

8. Intangible assets

Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Internally generated intangibles, excluding capitalised development costs, are not capitalised and the related

### Intangible Assets

The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either infinite or finite.

Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired.

The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are considered to modify the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates.

The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in the statement of profit and loss unless such expenditure forms part of carrying value of another asset.

Intangible assets with infinite useful lives are not amortised, but are tested for impairment annually, either individually or at the cash-generating unit level. The assessment of infinite life is reviewed annually to determine whether the infinite life continues to be supportable. If not, the change in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis.

### Gains or Losses

Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the statement of profit and loss when the asset is derecognised.

### Amortisation

Intangible assets are amortised on straight line method as under:

- Software expenditure is amortised over a period of three years.
- Technical Know-how and Brands are amortised over a period of twenty years.

### Technical Know-how and Brand

The Company has originally generated technical know-how and assistance for setting up of Halol radial plant. Considering the life of the underlying plant/facility, this technical know-how is amortised on a straight line basis over a period of twenty years.

## The Company has acquired global rights of “CEAT” brand from the Italian tyre maker, Pirelli. Prior to the said acquisition, the Company was the owner of the brand.

## FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## for the year ended March 31, 2017

To the extent that the Company borrows funds specifically for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset, the Company determines the amount of borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation as the actual borrowing costs incurred on that borrowing during the period less any investment income on the temporary investment of those borrowings.

To the extent that the Company borrows funds generally and uses them for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset, the Company determines the amount of borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation by applying a capitalisation rate to the expenditures on that asset. The capitalisation rate is the weighted average of the borrowing costs applicable to the borrowings of the Company that are outstanding during the period, other than borrowings made specifically for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset.

## Leases

The determination of whether an arrangement is (or contains) a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at the inception of the lease. The arrangement is, or contains, a lease if fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets and the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset or assets, even if that right is not explicitly specified in an arrangement.

For arrangements entered into prior to April 1, 2015, the Company has determined whether the arrangement contains a lease on the basis of facts and circumstances existing on the date of transition.

### Company as a lessee

Finance lease

A lease is classified at the inception date as a finance lease or an operating lease. A lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership to the Company is classified as a finance lease.

Finance leases are capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the inception date fair value of the leased property or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are recognised in finance costs in the statement of profit and loss, unless they are directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised in accordance with the Company’s general policy on the borrowing costs. Contingent rentals are recognised as expenses in the periods in which they are incurred.

### Operating lease

Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the statement of profit and loss on a straight line basis unless payments to the lessor are structured to increase in line with expected general inflation to compensate for the lessor’s expected inflationary cost increase.

## Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.

Costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and conditions are accounted for as follows:

- Raw materials, components, stores and spares are valued at lower of cost and net realizable value. However, materials and other items held for use in the production of inventories are not written down below cost if the finished products in which they will be incorporated are expected to be sold at or above cost. Cost is determined on a weighted average basis. Cost of raw material is net of duty benefits under Duty Entitlement Exemption Certificate (DEEC) scheme.
- Work-in-progress and finished goods are valued at lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost includes direct materials and labour and a proportion of manufacturing overheads based on normal operating capacity but excluding borrowing cost. Cost of finished goods includes excise duty. Cost is determined on a weighted average basis.
- Traded goods are valued at lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost includes cost of purchase and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost is determined on a weighted average basis.

Initial cost of inventories includes the transfer of gains and losses on qualifying cash flow hedges, recognised in OCI, in respect of the purchases of raw materials.

## Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

| The Company assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Company estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s (CGU) fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. Recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. When the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.                                                                                                                                            |     |
| In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded companies or other available fair value indicators.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |     |
| The Company bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecast calculations, which are prepared separately for each of the Company’s CGUs to which the individual assets are allocated. These budgets and forecast calculations generally cover a period of five years. For longer periods, a long-term growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth year. To estimate cash flow projections beyond periods covered by the most recent budgets/forecasts, the Company extrapolates cash flow projections in the budget using a steady or declining growth rate for subsequent years, unless an increasing rate can be justified. In any case, this growth rate does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the products, industries, or country or countries in which the entity operates, or for the market in which the asset is used. |     |
| Impairment losses of continuing operations, including impairment on inventories, are recognised in the statement of profit and loss.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |     |
| An assessment is made at each reporting date to determine whether there is an indication that previously recognised impairment losses no longer exist or have decreased. If such indication exists, the Company estimates the asset’s or CGU’s recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.                                                                                           |     |

| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. When the Company expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example, under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset, but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to a provision is presented in the statement of profit and loss net of any reimbursement. |     |
| If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |     |

| The estimated liability for warranty is recorded when products are sold. These estimates are established using historical information on the nature, frequency and average cost of obligations and management estimates regarding possible future incidence based on corrective actions on product failure. The timing of outflows will vary as and when the obligation will arise being typically up to three years. Initial recognition is based on historical experience. The initial estimate of warranty-related costs is revised annually.                                                                                                          |     |

14. Retirement and oper employee benefits
    Defined Contribution plan
    Retirement benefit in pe form of Provident Fund, Superannuation, Employees State Insurance Contribution and Labour Welfare Fund are defined contribution scheme. The Company has no obligation, oper pan pe contribution payable to pe above mentioned funds. The Company recognizes contribution payable to pe provident fund scheme as an expense, when an employee renders pe related service. If pe contribution payable to pe scheme for service received before pe balance sheet date exceeds pe contribution already paid, pe deficit payable to pe scheme is recognized as a liability after deducting pe contribution already paid. If pe contribution already paid exceeds pe contribution due for services received before pe balance sheet date, pen excess is recognized as an asset to pe extent pat pe pre-payment will lead to, for example, a reduction in future payment or a cash refund.
    Defined benefit plan
    The Company has a defined benefit gratuity plan, which requires contribution to be made to a separately administered fund. The Company’s liability towards pis benefit is determined on pe basis of actuarial valuation using Projected Unit Credit Mepod at pe date of balance sheet.
    Remeasurement, comprising of actuarial gains and losses, pe effect of pe asset ceiling, excluding amounts included in net interest on pe net defined benefit liability and pe return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net interest on pe net defined benefit liability), are recognised immediately in pe balance sheet wip a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings prough OCI in pe period in which pey occur. Remeasurement is not reclassified to statement of profit and loss in subsequent periods.
    Past service costs are recognised in statement of profit and loss on pe earlier of:

- The date of pe plan amendment or curtailment and
- The date pat pe Company recognises related restructuring costs

Compensated absences

Accumulated leave, which is expected to be utilized within the next 12 months, is treated as short-term employee benefit and this is shown under short term provision in the Balance Sheet. The Company measures the expected cost of such absences as the additional amount that it expects to pay as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the reporting date.

The Company treats accumulated leave expected to be carried forward beyond twelve months, as long-term employee benefit for measurement purposes and this is shown under long term provisions in the Balance Sheet. Such long-term compensated absences are provided for based on the actuarial valuation using the projected unit credit method at the year-end. Actuarial gains/losses are immediately taken to the Statement of Other Comprehensive Income and are not deferred. The Company presents the leave as a current liability in the balance sheet, to the extent it does not have an unconditional right to defer its settlement for 12 months after the reporting date. Where the Company has the unconditional legal and contractual right to defer the settlement for a period beyond 12 months, the same is presented as non-current liability.

Termination benefits

The Company recognizes termination benefit as a liability and an expense when the Company has a present obligation as a result of past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the termination benefit falls due for more than 12 months after the balance sheet date, they are measured at present value of the future cash flows using the discount rate determined by reference to market yields at the balance sheet date on the government bonds.

A financial instrument is any contract pat gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of anoper entity.
Financial assets
Initial recognition and measurement
All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in pe case of financial assets not recorded at fair value prough profit and loss, transaction costs pat are attributable to pe acquisition of pe financial asset.
Purchase or sale of financial asset pat require delivery of assets wipin a time frame established by regulation or convention in pe market place (regular way trades) are recognised on pe trade date, i.e., pe date pat pe Company commits to purchase or sell pe asset.
Subsequent measurement
For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in four categories:
Debt instruments at amortised cost
Debt instruments at fair value prough oper comprehensive income (FVTOCI)
Debt instruments, derivatives and equity instruments at fair value prough profit and loss (FVTPL)
Equity instruments measured at fair value prough oper comprehensive income (FVTOCI)
Debt instruments at amortised cost
A 'debt instrument' is measured at pe amortised cost if bop pe following conditions are met:
After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using pe effective interest rate (EIR) mepod.
Equity investments
All equity investments in scope of Ind AS 109 are measured at fair value. Equity instruments which are held for trading are classified as at FVTPL. For all oper equity instruments, pe Company may make an irrevocable election to present in oper comprehensive income subsequent changes in pe fair value. The Company makes such election on an instrument-by-instrument basis. The classification is made on initial recognition and is irrevocable.

### NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

for the year ended March 31, 2017

In case of equity instrument classified as FVTOCI, all fair value changes on the instrument, excluding dividends, are recognized in the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from OCI to statement of profit and loss, even on sale of investment. However, the Company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity.

Equity instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the statement of profit and loss.

Derecognition

A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is primarily derecognised when:

- The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired or
- The Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement, and either (a) the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.

The Company follows ‘simplified approach’ for recognition of impairment loss allowance on:

- Trade receivables
- All lease receivables resulting from transactions within the scope of Ind AS 17

The application of simplified approach does not require the Company to track changes in credit risk. Rather, it recognizes impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date, right from its initial recognition.

For recognition of impairment loss on other financial assets and risk exposure, the company determines that whether there has been a significant increase in the credit risk since initial recognition. If credit risk has not increased significantly, 12-month ECL is used to provide for impairment loss. However, if credit risk has increased significantly, lifetime ECL is used. If, in a subsequent period, credit quality of the instrument improves such that there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, then the entity reverts to recognizing impairment loss allowance based on 12-month ECL.

## Lifetime ECL are the expected credit losses resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument. The 12-month ECL is a portion of the lifetime ECL which results from default events that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date.

CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended March 31, 2017

ECL is the difference between all contractual cash flows that are due to the company in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the entity expects to receive (i.e., all cash shortfalls), discounted at the original EIR. When estimating the cash flows, an entity is required to consider:

- All contractual terms of the financial instrument (including prepayment, extension, call and similar options) over the expected life of the financial instrument. However, in rare cases when the expected life of the financial instrument cannot be estimated reliably, then the entity is required to use the remaining contractual term of the financial instrument
- Cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms

As a practical expedient, the Company uses a provision matrix to determine impairment loss allowance on a portfolio of its trade receivables. The provision matrix is based on its historically observed default rates over the expected life of the trade receivables and is adjusted for forward-looking estimates. At every reporting date, the historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analyzed.

ECL impairment loss allowance (or reversal) recognized during the period is recognized as income/expense in the statement of profit and loss. This amount is reflected under the head ‘other expenses’ in the statement of profit and loss. The balance sheet presentation for various financial instruments is described below:

- Financial assets measured as at amortized cost, contractual revenue receivables and lease receivables: ECL is presented as an allowance, i.e., as an integral part of the measurement of those assets in the balance sheet. The allowance reduces the net carrying amount. Until the asset meets write-off criteria, the Company does not reduce impairment allowance from the gross carrying amount.
- Debt instruments measured at FVTOCI: Since financial assets are already reflected at fair value, impairment allowance is not further reduced from its value.

For assessing an increase in credit risk and impairment loss, the Company combines financial instruments on the basis of shared credit risk characteristics with the objective of facilitating an analysis that is designed to enable significant increases in credit risk to be identified on a timely basis.

The Company does not have any purchased or originated credit-impaired (POCI) financial assets, i.e., financial assets which are credit impaired on purchase/origination.

Financial liabilities Initial recognition and measurement Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through the statement of profit and loss, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. All financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value and, in the case of loans, borrowings, and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.

The Company’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings including bank overdrafts, financial guarantee contracts, and derivative financial instruments.

Subsequent measurement The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below:

- Financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss Financial liabilities at fair value through the statement of profit and loss include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through the statement of profit and loss. Financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term. This category also includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the company that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by Ind AS 109.
- Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognized in the statement of profit and loss.
- Financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through the statement of profit and loss are designated as such at the initial date of recognition, and only if the criteria in Ind AS 109 are satisfied. For liabilities designated as FVTPL, fair value gains/losses attributable to changes in own credit risks are recognized in OCI. These gains/losses are not subsequently transferred to the statement of profit and loss. However, the Company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity. All other changes in the fair value of such liability are recognized in the statement of profit or loss. The Company has not designated any financial liability as at fair value through profit and loss.

Loans and borrowings

This is the category most relevant to the Company. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. Gains and losses are recognised in statement of profit and loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the statement of profit and loss.

Financial guarantee contracts

Financial guarantee contracts issued by the Company are those contracts that require a payment to be made to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because the specified debtor fails to make a payment when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. Financial guarantee contracts are recognised initially as a liability at fair value, adjusted for transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issuance of the guarantee. Subsequently, the liability is measured at the higher of the amount of loss allowance determined as per impairment requirements of Ind AS 109 and the amount recognised less cumulative amortisation.

Derecognition

A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

| Amortised cost          | FVTPL                  | Fair value is measured at reclassification date.

| FVTPL                   | Amortised Cost         | Fair value at reclassification date becomes its new gross carrying amount. EIR is calculated based on the new gross carrying amount.

| FVTOCI                  | Amortised cost         | Fair value at reclassification date becomes its new amortised cost carrying amount. However, cumulative gain or loss in OCI is adjusted against fair value. Consequently, the asset is measured as if it had always been measured at amortised cost.                                                            |
| FVTPL                   | FVTOCI                 | Fair value at reclassification date becomes its new carrying amount. No other adjustment is required. Assets continue to be measured at fair value. Cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in OCI is reclassified to statement of profit and loss at the reclassification date.                          |

The following table shows various reclassifications and how they are accounted for:

## CORPORATE OVERVIEW

## STATUTORY REPORTS

## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

for the year ended March 31, 2017

Offsetting of financial instruments

Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. Amounts recognised as OCI are transferred to statement of profit and loss when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when the hedged financial income or financial expense is recognised or when a forecast sale occurs. When the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability, the amounts recognised as OCI are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability.

## Derivative financial instruments

The Company uses derivative financial instruments, such as forward currency contracts, to manage its foreign currency risks. These derivative instruments are designated as cash flow, fair value or net investment hedges and are entered into for period consistent with currency. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative. Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives are taken directly to statement of profit and loss.

Fair value hedges

The change in the fair value of a hedging instrument is recognised in the statement of profit and loss as finance costs. The change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk hedged is recorded as part of the carrying value of the hedged item and is also recognised in the statement of profit and loss as finance costs. For fair value hedges relating to items carried at amortised cost, any adjustment to carrying value is amortised through statement of profit and loss over the remaining term of the hedge using the EIR method. EIR amortisation may begin as soon as an adjustment exists and no later than when the hedged item ceases to be adjusted for changes in its fair value attributable to the risk being hedged.

If the hedged item is derecognised, the unamortised fair value is recognised immediately in statement of profit and loss. When an unrecognised firm commitment is designated as a hedged item, the subsequent cumulative change in the fair value of the firm commitment attributable to the hedged risk is recognised as an asset or liability with a corresponding gain or loss recognised in statement of profit and loss.

Cash flow hedges

The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) in the cash flow hedge reserve, while any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the statement of profit and loss.

18. Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks and on hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less, which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.

19. Dividend distribution to equity holders

The Company recognises a liability to make cash to equity holders of the Company when the distribution is authorised and the distribution is no longer at the discretion of the Company. As per the corporate laws in India, a distribution is authorised when it is approved by the shareholders. A corresponding amount is recognised directly in equity.

20. Foreign currencies

The Company’s financial statements are presented in ₹, which is also the Company’s functional currency. Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the Company at ₹ spot rate at the date the transaction first qualifies for recognition. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency spot rates of exchange at the reporting date.

Exchange differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognised in statement of profit and loss.

Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value is determined. The gain or loss arising on translation of non-monetary items measured at fair value is treated in line with the recognition of the gain or loss on the change in fair value of the item (i.e., translation differences on items whose fair value gain or loss is recognised in OCI or statement of profit and loss are also recognised in OCI or statement of profit and loss, respectively).

For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Company determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.

For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Company has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above.

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:

- Level 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
- Level 2 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable
- Level 3 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable

## The Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.

21. Earnings Per Share

Basic Earnings per share (EPS) amounts are calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to equity holders of the company by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year.

Diluted EPS amounts are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the company after adjusting impact of dilution shares by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of equity shares that would be issued on conversion of all the dilutive potential equity shares into equity shares.

22. Segment Reporting

Based on “Management Approach” as defined in Ind AS 108 -Operating Segments, the Executive Management Committee evaluates the Company’s performance and allocates the resources based on an analysis of various performance indicators by business segments.

The Company prepares its segment information in conformity with the accounting policies adopted for preparing and presenting the financial statements of the Company as a whole.

23. Contingent liabilities and assets

A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose existence will be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Company or a present obligation that is not recognized because it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation. A contingent liability also arises in extremely rare cases where there is a liability that cannot be recognized because it cannot be measured reliably. The Company does not recognize a contingent liability but discloses its existence in the financial statements.

A contingent asset is not recognized unless it becomes virtually certain that an inflow of economic benefits will arise. When an inflow of economic benefits is probable, contingent assets are disclosed in the financial statements. Contingent liabilities and contingent assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date.

1. In an earlier year, the Company has acquired global rights of “CEAT” brand from the Italian tyre maker, Pirelli. Prior to the said acquisition, the Company was the owner of the brand in only few Asian countries including India. With the acquisition of the brand which is renowned worldwide, new and hitherto unexplored markets are accessible to the Company. The Company will be in a position to fully exploit the export market resulting in increased volume and price realization. Therefore, the management believes that the Brand will yield significant benefits for a period of at least twenty years.

2. The Company has acquired technical know-how and assistance from International Tire Engineering Resources LLC, for setting up Halol radial plant. Considering the life of the underlying plant / facility, this technical know-how, is amortized on a straight line basis over a period of twenty years.

## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## for the year ended March 31, 2017

Note 40: Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions

The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require an adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities in future periods. Difference between actual results and estimates are recognised in the periods in which the results are known / materialised.

Estimates and assumptions

The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are described below. The Company has based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the financial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances arising that are beyond the control of the Company. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.

a) Taxes

Uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of complex tax regulations and the amount and timing of future taxable income. Given the wide range of business relationships and the long-term nature and complexity of existing contractual agreements, differences arising between the actual results and the assumptions made, or future changes to such assumptions, could necessitate future adjustments to tax income and expense already recorded. The Company establishes provisions, based on reasonable estimates, for possible consequences of audits by the tax authorities of the respective countries in which it operates. The amount of such provisions is based on various factors, such as experience of previous tax audits and differing interpretations of tax regulations by the taxable entity and the responsible tax authority. Such differences of interpretation may arise on a wide variety of issues depending on the conditions prevailing in the Company’s domicile. Based on approved plans and budgets, the company has estimated that the future taxable income will be sufficient to absorb MAT credit entitlement, which management believes is probable. Accordingly, the Company has recognized MAT credit as an asset. Further details on taxes are disclosed in note 23.

b) Defined benefit plans (gratuity benefits)

The Company’s obligation on account of gratuity, compensated absences and present value of gratuity obligation are determined based on actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, these liabilities are highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.

The parameter most subject to change is the discount rate. In determining the appropriate discount rate, the management considers the interest rates of government bonds in currencies consistent with the currencies of the post-employment benefit obligation.

The mortality rate is based on publicly available mortality tables. Those mortality tables tend to change only at interval in response to demographic changes. Increase in future salary and gratuity is based on expected future inflation rates.

Further details about gratuity obligations are given in note 41.

c) Provision for decommissioning liability

The Company has recognised a provision for decommissioning obligations associated with a land taken on lease at Nashik manufacturing facility for the production of tyres. In determining the fair value of the provision, assumptions and estimates are made in relation to discount rates, the expected cost to dismantle and remove the plant from the site and the expected timing of those costs. The carrying amount of the provision as at March 31, 2017 was `54.69 lacs (March 31, 2016: `49.06 lacs, April 1, 2015: `44.00 lacs). The Company estimates that the costs would be realised in year 2066 at the expiration of the lease and calculates the provision using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method based on the following assumptions:

- Estimated range of cost per square meter – `45 – `50
- Discount rate – 11.50%

d) Provision for warranty

The estimated liability for warranty is recorded when products are sold. These estimates are established using historical information on the nature, frequency and average cost of obligations and management estimates regarding possible future incidence based on corrective actions.

actions on product failure. The timing of outflows will vary qualifying Insurance policy. The company’s defined benefit gratuity plan is a salary plan for employees which requires contributions to be made to a separate administrative fund.

e) Fair value measurement of financial instruments

When the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques including the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values. Judgements include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments. See Note 47 and 48 for further disclosures.

### NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

for the year ended March 31, 2017

| Particulars                            | As at March 31, 2017 | As at March 31, 2016 |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| Expected return on plan assets         | 657.78               | 499.56               |
| Actuarial gain / (loss) on plan assets | (42.80)              | 150.95               |
| Actual return on plan assets           | 614.98               | 650.51               |

The major categories of Plan Assets as a percentage of the Fair Value of Plan Assets are as follows:

| Particulars             | As at March 31, 2017 | As at March 31, 2016 |
| ----------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| Investment with Insurer | 100%                 | 100%                 |

The principal assumptions used in determining gratuity and leave encashment for the Company’s plan are shown below:

Description of risk exposures:

- Interest rate risk
- Liquidity risk
- Salary escalation risk

Valuations are performed on certain basic set of predetermined assumptions and other regulatory framework which may vary overtime. Thus, the Company is exposed to various risks in providing the above gratuity benefit which are as follows:

Interest rate risk: The plan exposes the Company to the risk of fall in interest rates. A fall in interest rates will result in an increase in the ultimate cost of providing the above benefit and will thus result in an increase in the value of the liability (as shown in financial statements).

Liquidity risk: This is the risk that the Company is not able to meet the short-term gratuity payouts. This may arise due to non-availability of enough cash/cash equivalent to meet the liabilities or holding of illiquid assets not being sold in time.

Salary escalation risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan is calculated with the assumption of salary increase rate of plan participants in the future. Deviation in the rate of increase of salary in the future for plan participants from the rate of increase in salary used to determine the present value of obligation will have a bearing on the plan’s liability.

Regulatory risk: Gratuity benefit is paid in accordance with the requirements of the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 (as amended from time to time). There is a risk of change in regulations requiring higher gratuity payouts (e.g. Increase in the maximum limit on gratuity of `10 lacs).

Demographic risk: The Company has used certain mortality and attrition assumptions in valuation of the liability. The Company is exposed to the risk of actual experience turning out to be worse compared to the assumption.

Asset liability mismatching or market risk: The duration of the liability is longer compared to the duration of assets, exposing the Company to market risk for volatilities/fall in interest rate.

## Investment risk: The probability or likelihood of occurrence of losses relative to the expected return on any particular investment.

The estimates of future salary increase, considered in actuarial valuation, take account of inflation, seniority and other relevant factors, such as supply and demand in the employment market.

The sensitivity analysis below have been determined based on reasonably possible change of the assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions constant. The results of sensitivity analysis is given below:

| Particulars                       | As at March 31, 2017 | As at March 31, 2016 |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| Defined Benefit Obligation (Base) | 9,542.65             | 8,708.77             |

A quantitative sensitivity analysis for significant assumption as at March 31, 2017 is as shown below:

| Particulars                                    | 2016-17   | 2015-16   |

| (% change compared to base due to sensitivity) | 8.7%      | (7.5%)    |
| Salary Growth Rate (- / + 1%)                  | 8,818.38  | 10,357.46 |
| (% change compared to base due to sensitivity) | (7.6%)    | 8.5%      |
| Attrition Rate (- / + 1%)                      | 9,617.57  | 9,483.89  |
| (% change compared to base due to sensitivity) | 0.8%      | (0.6%)    |
| Mortality Rate (- / + 1%)                      | 9,543.07  | 9,542.22  |
| (% change compared to base due to sensitivity) | 0.0%      | 0.0%      |

The sensitivity analysis above have been determined based on a method that extrapolates the impact on defined benefit obligation as a result of reasonable changes in key assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period.

The Company has purchased an insurance policy to provide for payment of gratuity to the employees. Every year, the insurance company carries out a funding valuation based on the latest employee data provided by the Company. Any deficit in the assets arising as a result of such valuation is funded by the Company.

The Company’s best estimate of contribution during the next year is ` 1,582.13 lacs.

## The weighted average duration (based on discounted cash flows) of defined benefit obligation is 8 years.

## FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

for the year ended March 31, 2017

| Particulars                                              | March 31, 2017 As at | March 31, 2016 As at |

| Between 2 and 5 years                                    | 3,558.90             | 3,219.91             |

| Beyond 10 years                                          | 9,610.93             | 9,257.48             |
| Total expected payments                                  | 18,728.51            | 17,992.73            |

The Company has purchased insurance policy, which is basically a year-on-year cash accumulation plan in which the interest rate is declared on yearly basis and is guaranteed for a period of one year. The insurance Company, as part of the policy rules, makes payment of all gratuity out flows happening during the year (subject to sufficiency of funds under the policy). The policy, thus, mitigates the liquidity risk. However, being a cash accumulation plan, the duration of assets is shorter compared to the duration of liabilities. Thus, the Company is exposed to movement in interest rate (in particular, the significant fall in interest rates, which should result in an increase in liability without corresponding increase in the asset).

d. Others

The Company has availed the Sales Tax Deferral Loan and Octroi refund from the Directorate of Industries for Nashik Plant. Hence, the Company has to take prior permission of the appropriate authority for removal/transfer of any asset (falling under the above schemes) from Nashik Plant. In case of violation of terms & conditions, the Company is required to refund the entire loan/benefit along with the interest @ 22.50% on account of Sales Tax Deferral Loan and @ 15% on account of Octroi refund. (Refer Note 29(b)).

e. Demands and disputes considered as “Remote” by the Company

1. The Company has been served with a Show Cause cum Demand Notice from the DGCEI (Directorate General of Central Excise Intelligence) Mumbai, on the ground that, the activity of making tyre set, i.e. inserting Tubes and Flaps inside the Tyres and tied up through Polypropylene Straps, amounts to manufacture / pre-packaged commodity under Section 2(f)(iii) of Central Excise Act, read with Section 2(l) of the Legal Metrology Act, 2009. Accordingly, the authorities worked out the differential duty amounting to `8,655.63 lacs i.e., the amount of duty already paid on the basis of transaction value and duty payable on the basis of MRP under Section 4A, for the period from April-2011 to April-2015. The Company believes that Set of TT / TTF (Tyre and Tube / Tyre, Tube and Flap) is not pre-packaged commodity in terms of provisions of Legal Metrology Act, 2009. The Company has a strong case on the ground that, the said issue has been clarified by the Controller of the Legal Metrology Department vide its letter dated May 1, 1991 that “Tyre with tube & flaps tied with three thin polythene strips may not be treated as a pre-packed commodity within the meaning of rule 2(l) of the Standards of Weights and Measures (Packaged Commodities), Rules, 1977”. The above clarification has been re-affirmed vide letter dated November 16, 1992 by the Legal Metrology authorities.
2. The Competition Commission of India (CCI) had, while considering the representation made by All India Tyres Dealers Federation (AITDF) made a prima facie view that the major players of tyre industry (including the Company) had some understanding amongst themselves, especially in the replacement market, as they did not pass the benefit of corresponding reduction in prices of major raw material inputs for the period subsequent to the year 2011-12. According to CCI, this practice is in violation of the Competition Act 2002 (the Act). Therefore, CCI had, vide its order passed on June 24, 2014 under Section 26(1) of the Act, directed the Office of the Director General (DG) to investigate the said alleged violation of the Act. DG submitted its Investigation Report to CCI in December 2015, based on which CCI passed an order on February 18, 2016 directing the said tyre manufacturers to file their suggestions/objections by May 5, 2016. Objections were filed as directed and the CCI had also heard the tyre manufacturers in detail. The case was last posted on December 1, 2016 and is now reserved for Orders. The Company’s decision to change the price is purely a business decision which depends upon many factors like cost of production, brand value perception, profit margin of each product, quality perception of each product in the market, demand and supply situation of each product category and market potential and market shares targets of various product categories etc. In view of the above, Company believes that it has a strong case hence, considered as remote.

The management assessed that fair values of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, trade payables less than 1 year, bank overdrafts, current borrowing and other current financial assets and liabilities (except derivative financial instrument those being measured at fair value through other comprehensive income) approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.

The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities is included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. The foreign exchange forward contracts used for hedging the recognized import trade payables / export trade receivables have been valued based on the Closing spot value. The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values:

- The fair value of quoted mutual funds are based on price quotations at the reporting date.

## CORPORATE OVERVIEW

## STATUTORY REPORTS

## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

for the year ended March 31, 2017

\*For valuation under level 3 following assumptions were made: The analysis exclude the impact of movements in market variables on: the carrying values of gratuity and other post-retirement obligations and provisions.

a. All repayments of borrowings will happen at end of financial year and not during the year.

b. For valuation purpose we have taken discounting rate of 11.50% which represents additional borrowing rate.

## Note 48 : Financial risk management objectives and policies

The Company’s principal financial liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise loans and borrowings, trade and other payables. The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Company’s operations. The Company’s principal financial assets include trade and other receivables, mutual fund investments, and cash and cash equivalents that derive directly from its operations. The Company also enters into derivative transactions.

The Company’s financial risk activities are governed by appropriate policies and procedures and that financial risks are identified, measured and managed in accordance with the Company’s policies and risk objectives. All derivative activities for risk management purposes are carried out by specialist teams that have the appropriate skills, experience and supervision. The Board of Directors through its risk managements committee reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.

### a. Market risk

Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk, such as equity price risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk include loans and borrowings, deposits, investments and derivative financial instruments.

The sensitivity analysis in the following sections relate to the position as at March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016. The sensitivity analysis have been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and derivatives and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant and on the basis of hedge designations in place at March 31, 2017.

#### i. Interest rate risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Company’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Company’s long-term debt obligations with floating interest rates.

The Company manages its interest rate risk by having a balanced portfolio of fixed and variable rate loans and borrowings. To manage this, the Company enters into interest rate swaps, in which it agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. At March 31, 2017, after taking into account the effect of interest rate swaps, approximately 58% of the Company’s total borrowings are at a fixed rate of interest (March 31, 2016: 50%; April 1, 2015: 55%).

| Particulars              | As at March 31, 2017 | As at March 31, 2016 | As at April 1, 2015 |
| ------------------------ | -------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------- |

The assumed movement in basis points for the interest rate sensitivity analysis is based on the currently observable market environment, showing a significantly higher volatility than in prior years.

ii. Foreign currency risk

Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. The Company’s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to the Company’s operating activities (when revenue or expense is denominated in a foreign currency) and the Company’s net investments in foreign subsidiaries.

The Company manages its foreign currency risk by hedging transactions that are expected to occur within a maximum 6 month period for the foreign currency denominated trade payables and trade receivables. The foreign currency risk on the foreign currency loans are mitigated by entering into Cross Currency Swaps.

At March 31, 2017, the Company hedged 95% (March 31, 2016: 100%, April 1, 2015: 100 %), of its foreign currency loans. This foreign currency risk is hedged by using foreign currency forward contracts.

|                | The following tables demonstrate the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in USD and EURO rates, with all other variables held constant.

The movement in the pre-tax effect is a result of a change in the fair value of the financial asset/liability due to the exchange rate movement. The derivatives which have not been designated in a hedge relationship act as an economic hedge and will offset the underlying transactions when they occur. The same derivatives are not covered in the above table.

In management’s opinion, the sensitivity analysis is unrepresentative of the inherent foreign exchange risk because the exposure at the end of the reporting period does not reflect the exposure during the year.

iii. Equity price risk

The Company invests its surplus funds in various debt instruments and debt mutual funds. These comprise mainly of liquid schemes of mutual funds (liquid investments) and fixed deposits.

## Mutual fund investments are susceptible to market price risk, mainly arising from changes in the interest rates or market yields which may impact the return and value of such investments. However, due to the very short tenor of the underlying portfolio in the liquid schemes, these do not pose any significant price risk.

## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

for the year ended March 31, 2017

There is no material equity risk relating to the Company’s equity investments which are detailed in note 5. The Company equity investments majorly comprise of strategic investments rather than trading purposes.

b. Commodity price risk

The Company is affected by the price volatility of certain commodities. Its operating activities require the ongoing purchase of rubber and carbon black and therefore require a continuous supply of rubber and carbon black. Due to the significantly increased volatility of the price of the rubber and carbon black, the Company also entered into various purchase contracts for rubber and carbon black (for which there is an active market).

Commodity price sensitivity

The following table details the Company’s sensitivity to a 5% movement in the input price of rubber and carbon black. The sensitivity analysis includes only 5% change in commodity prices for quantity sold or consumed during the year, with all other variables held constant. A positive number below indicates an increase in profit or equity where the commodity prices decrease by 5%. For a 5% increase in commodity prices, there would be a comparable impact on profit or equity, and the balances below would be negative.

| Commodity        | Increase in profit due to decrease in commodity price | Decrease in profit due to increase in commodity price (` in lacs) |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Natural rubber   | 5,200.00                                              | (5,200.00)                                                        |

c. Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk that counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss. The Company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables) and from its financing activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions, foreign exchange transactions and other financial instruments.

Trade receivables

Customer credit risk is managed by each business unit subject to the Company’s established policy, procedures and control relating to customer credit risk management. Trade receivables are noninterest bearing and are generally on 30 days to 90 days credit term. Credit limits are established for all customers based on internal rating criteria. Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored. Credit risk on receivables is also mitigated by securing the same against security deposit, letter of credit, and advance payment.

An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date on an individual basis for major clients. In addition, a large number of minor receivables are grouped into homogenous groups and assessed for impairment collectively. The Company has no concentration of credit risk as the customer base is widely distributed both economically and geographically.

e. Excessive risk concentration

Concentrations arise when a number of counterparties are engaged in similar business activities, or activities in the same geographical region, or have economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic, political or other conditions. Concentrations indicate the relative sensitivity of the Company’s performance to developments affecting a particular industry.

In order to avoid excessive concentrations of risk, the Company’s policies and procedures include specific guidelines to focus on the maintenance of a diversified portfolio. Identified concentrations of credit risks are controlled and managed accordingly. Selective hedging is used within the Company to manage risk concentrations at both the relationship and industry levels.

Collateral

The Company has hypothecated the entire current assets to its consortium of bankers. The term lenders also have a second charge on the varied current assets.

| Both under Indian GAAP and Ind AS, the Company recognised costs related to its post-employment defined benefit plan on an actuarial basis. Under Indian GAAP, the entire cost, including actuarial gains and losses, are charged to profit or loss. Under Ind AS, remeasurements (comprising of actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling, excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability and the return on plan assets excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability) are recognised immediately in the balance sheet with a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through OCI. Thus the employee benefit cost is increased by ` 315.53 lacs and remeasurement losses on defined benefit plans have been recognized in the OCI net of tax.                                                        | Under Indian GAAP, unamortised transaction costs relating to borrowings is shown separately in assets, whereas under Ind AS such costs are netted off against the borrowings. Hence, as on the transition date unamortised transaction cost of ` 253.76 lacs is netted off against the borrowings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| Under Indian GAAP, the Company has accounted for provisions, including long-term provision, at the undiscounted amount. In contrast, Ind AS 37 requires that where the effect of time value of money is material, the amount of provision should be the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation. The discount rate(s) should not reflect risks for which future cash flow estimates have been adjusted. Ind AS 37 also provides that where discounting is used, the carrying amount of a provision increases in each period to reflect the passage of time. This increase is recognised as borrowing cost. This led to a decrease in provision on the date of transition by `194.25 lacs with corresponding impact on equity. In FY 2015-16, this led to a decrease in provision by` 7.92 lacs with a corresponding impact on revenue from sale of goods. | Excise duty of `66,236.76 lacs on account of sale of goods has been included in revenue as it is on own account because it is liability of the manufacturer which forms part of the production, irrespective of whether goods are sold or not. Under Indian GAAP, cash discount of ` 4,192.60 lacs was recognised as part of other expenses which has been adjusted against the revenue under Ind AS during the year ended March 31, 2016.                                                                                                                                                        |

| Under Indian GAAP, deferred tax is accounted using the income statement approach as per timing differences between taxable profits and accounting profits for the period. Ind AS 12 requires accounting for deferred taxes using the balance sheet approach as per temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet and its tax base. The application of Ind AS 12 approach has resulted in recognition of deferred tax on new temporary differences which was not required under Indian GAAP. In addition, the various transitional adjustments lead to temporary differences as on the transition date. The net impact on deferred tax liabilities on the transitional adjustments debited to equity is ` 74.08 Lacs.                                                                                                                               | The Company has elected the option to fair value its investment in subsidiaries i.e. CEAT AKKHAN Limited and RADO Tyres Limited at fair value as on the transition date.

The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its jointly controlled entities are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Group and jointly controlled entities and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; the selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated Ind AS financial statements by the Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.

## FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Annexure to the Independent Auditor’s Report of even date on the Consolidated Financial Statements of Ceat Limited

Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)

In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial statements of CEAT Limited as of and for the year ended March 31, 2017, we have audited the internal financial controls over financial reporting of CEAT Limited (hereinafter referred to as the “Holding Company”) and its subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in India, as of that date.

Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls

The respective Board of Directors of the Holding Company and its subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in India, are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Holding Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the respective company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.

Auditor’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal financial controls over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) and the Standards on Auditing, both, issued by Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, and deemed to be prescribed under section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls system over financial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of the internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms of their reports referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal financial controls system over financial reporting.

Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting

A company's internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting

Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control over financial reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

## CEAT LIMITED

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

### for the year ended March 31, 2017

#### Note 1: Corporate information

The consolidated financial statements comprise financial statements of CEAT Limited ("the company") and its subsidiaries (collectively, "the Group") and Joint Venture for the year ended March 31, 2017. The Company is a public company domiciled in India and incorporated under the provisions of the Companies Act applicable in India. The Group’s principal business is manufacturing and trading of automotive tyres, tubes and flaps. The Company started operations in 1958 as CEAT Tyres of India Limited and was renamed as CEAT Limited in 1990. The Company caters to both domestic and international markets. The Company’s shares are listed on two recognized stock exchanges in India. The registered office of the company is located at RPG House, 463, Dr. Annie Beasant Road, Worli, Mumbai 400030. The financial statements were authorized for issue in accordance with a resolution of the directors on April 28, 2017. Refer note 41 for the information related to subsidiary companies.

#### Note 2: Basis of Preparation, Basis of Consolidation and Summary of significant accounting policies

1. Basis of accounting and preparation of financial statements

The financial statements of the group have been prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) notified under the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015.

For all periods up to and including the year ended March 31, 2016, the Group prepared its financial statements in accordance with the accounting standards notified under section 133 of the Companies Act 2013, read together with paragraph 7 of the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014 (Indian GAAP). These financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2017 are the first financial statements the Group has prepared in accordance with Ind AS. Refer to note 54 for information on how the Group adopted Ind AS.

These financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the following assets and liabilities which have been measured at fair value:

- Derivative financial instruments
- Certain financial assets measured at fair value (refer accounting policy regarding financial instruments)

In addition, the carrying values of recognized assets and liabilities designated as hedged items in fair value hedges that would otherwise be carried at amortized cost are adjusted to record changes in the fair values attributable to the risks that are being hedged in effective hedge.

2. Basis of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries and Joint Venture as at March 31, 2017. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Specifically, the Group controls an investee if and only if the Group has:

- Power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee)
- Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee, and
- The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns

Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights result in control. To support this presumption and when the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee.

The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary.

## ANNUAL REPORT 2016-17

## FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

### NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended March 31, 2017

Consolidated financial statements are prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar circumstances. If a member of the group uses accounting policies other than those adopted in the consolidated financial statements for like transactions and events in similar circumstances, appropriate adjustments are made to that group member’s financial statements in preparing the consolidated financial statements to ensure conformity with the Group’s accounting policies.

All intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation.

A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction. If the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it:

- Derecognises the assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary
- Derecognises the carrying amount of any non-controlling interests
- Derecognises the cumulative translation differences recorded in equity
- Recognises the fair value of the consideration received
- Recognises the fair value of any investment retained
- Recognises any surplus or deficit in profit or loss

The financial statements of all entities used for the purpose of consolidation are drawn up to the same reporting date as that of the parent company, i.e., year ended on March 31. When the end of the reporting period of the parent is different from that of a subsidiary, the subsidiary prepares, for consolidation purposes, additional financial information in accordance with Ind AS as of the same date as the financial statements of the parent to enable the parent to consolidate the financial information of the subsidiary, unless it is impracticable to do so.

Consolidation procedure

1. Combine like items of assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows of the parent with those of its subsidiaries. For this purpose, income and expenses of the subsidiary are based on the amounts of the assets and liabilities recognised in the consolidated financial statements at the acquisition date.
2. Offset (eliminate) the carrying amount of the parent’s investment in each subsidiary and the parent’s portion of equity of each subsidiary. Business combinations policy explains how to account for any related goodwill.
3. Eliminate in full intragroup assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between entities of the group. Intragroup losses may indicate an impairment that requires recognition in the consolidated financial statements. Ind AS12 Income Taxes applies to temporary differences that arise from the elimination of profits and losses resulting from intragroup transactions.

The following subsidiaries and Joint Ventures have been considered in the consolidated financial statements

Subsidiaries

- CEAT AKKHAN Limited
- Associated CEAT Holdings Co. (Pvt) Limited (ACHL)
- RADO Tyres Limited
- CEAT Specialty Tyres Limited

Joint Venture

- CEAT Kelani Holdings Company (Pvt.) Limited (CKHL) - joint venture of ACHL
- Associated CEAT (Pvt.) Limited (ACPL) – subsidiary of CKHL
- CEAT Kelani International Tyres (Pvt.) Limited (CKITL) - subsidiary of CKHL
- CEAT Kelani Radials Limited (CKRL) - subsidiary of CKHL
- Asian Tyres (Pvt.) Limited - subsidiary of CKITL

Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income (OCI) are attributed to the equity holders of the parent of the Group and to the non-controlling interests, even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. When necessary, adjustments are made.

Business Combination

In accordance with Ind AS 101 provisions related to first-time adoption, the Group has elected to apply Ind AS accounting for business combinations prospectively from April 1, 2015. As such, Indian GAAP balances relating to

## CEAT LIMITED

## CORPORATE OVERVIEW

## STATUTORY REPORTS

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

for the year ended March 31, 2017

business combinations entered into before that date, have been carried forward with minimal adjustment (refer note 54). The same first time adoption exemption is also used for joint ventures.

Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred measured at fair value as on acquisition date and the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree. For each business combination, the Group elects whether to measure the non-controlling interests in the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.

At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognised at their acquisition date fair values.

Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability that is a financial instrument and within the scope of Ind AS 109 Financial Instruments, is measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the statement of profit and loss. If the contingent consideration is not within the scope of Ind AS 109, it is measured in accordance with the appropriate Ind AS. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not re-measured at subsequent reporting dates and subsequently its settlement is accounted for within equity.

Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for non-controlling interests, and any previous interest held, over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Any gain on a bargain purchase is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity as capital reserve if there exists clear evidence, of the underlying reasons for classifying the business combination as resulting in a bargain purchase; otherwise the gain is recognised in equity as capital reserve.

After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.

A cash generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognised in the statement of profit and loss. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.

Where goodwill has been allocated to a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the disposed operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal. Goodwill disposed in these circumstances is measured based on the relative values of the disposed operation and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.

Investment in joint ventures

A joint venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the joint venture. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.

The considerations made in determining whether joint control are similar to those necessary to determine control over the subsidiaries.

The Group’s investments in joint venture are accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method, the investment in a joint venture is initially recognised at cost. The carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to recognise changes in the Group’s share of net assets of joint venture since the acquisition date. Goodwill relating to joint venture is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is not tested for impairment individually. The statement of profit and loss reflects the Group’s share of the results of operations of joint venture. Any change in OCI of those investees is presented as part of the Group’s OCI. In addition, when there has been a change recognised directly in the equity of joint venture, the Group recognises its share of any changes, when applicable, in the statement of changes in equity. Unrealised gains and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and joint venture are eliminated to the extent of the interest in joint venture.

## ANNUAL REPORT 2016-17 231

## FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

### NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended March 31, 2017

The aggregate of the Group’s share of profit or loss of a joint venture is shown on the face of the statement of profit and loss.

The financial statements of joint venture are prepared for the same reporting period as the Group. When necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies in line with those of the Group.

After application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognise an impairment loss on its investment in its joint venture. At each reporting date, the Group determines whether there is objective evidence that the investment in joint venture is impaired. If there is such evidence, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of joint venture and its carrying value, and then recognises the loss as ‘Share of profit of a joint venture’ in the statement of profit and loss.

### Revenue recognition

Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured, regardless of when the payment is being made. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, taking into account contractually defined terms of payment and excluding taxes or duties collected on behalf of the government. The Group has concluded that it is the principal in all of its revenue arrangements since it is the primary obligor in all the revenue arrangements as it has pricing latitude and is also exposed to inventory and credit risks.

Based on the Educational Material on Ind AS 18 issued by the ICAI, the Group has assumed that recovery of excise duty flows to the group on its own account. This is for the reason that it is a liability of the manufacturer which forms part of the cost of production, irrespective of whether the goods are sold or not. Since the recovery of excise duty flows to the group on its own account, revenue includes excise duty.

However, Sales tax/ Value Added Tax (VAT) is not received by the Group on its own account. Rather, it is tax collected on value added to the commodity by the seller on behalf of the government. Accordingly, it is excluded from revenue.

The specific recognition criteria described below must also be met before revenue is recognised.

### Current versus non-current classification

The Group presents assets and liabilities in the balance sheet based on current/ non-current classification. An asset is treated as current when it is:

- Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in normal operating cycle
- Held primarily for the purpose of trading
- Expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting period, or
- Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period

All other assets are classified as non-current.

A liability is current when:

- It is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle
- It is held primarily for the purpose of trading
- It is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period, or
- There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period

The Group classifies all other liabilities as non-current.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities.

The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realisation in cash and cash equivalents. The Group has identified twelve months as its operating cycle.

Interest income

## For all debt instruments measured either at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income, interest income is recorded using the effective interest rate (EIR). EIR is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts over the expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate, to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset or to the amortised cost of a financial liability.

Calculating the effective interest rate, the Group estimates or substantively enacted, at the reporting date in the countries where the Group operates and generates taxable income.

Interest income is included in finance income in the statement of profit and loss.

### Dividends

Revenue is recognised when the Group’s right to receive the payment is established, which is generally when shareholders approve the dividend.

### Royalty and Technology development fees

Royalty and technology development fees income are accounted for as per the terms of the contract.

### Government grants and Export incentives

Government grants are recognised where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all attached conditions will be complied with.

Export Incentives such as Focus Market Scheme, Focus Products Scheme and Special Focus Market Scheme are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss as a part of other operating revenues.

### Taxes

Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.

## The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted.

In respect of deductible temporary differences

Non-current assets held for sale associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are re-assessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.

Non-current assets held for sale/for distribution to owners and disposal groups are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and the fair value less costs to sell/distribute. Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale/distribution are presented separately in the balance sheet.

Property, plant and equipment once classified as held for sale/distribution to owners are not depreciated or amortised.

Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Capital work in progress is stated at cost. Cost comprises the purchase price and any attributable cost of bringing asset to its working condition for its intended use only. Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of the plant and equipment and borrowing costs for long-term construction projects if the recognition criteria are met. Subsequent expenditure related to an item of fixed asset is added to its book value only if it increases the future benefits from the existing asset beyond its previously assessed standard of performance. When significant parts of plant and equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the Group depreciates them separately based on their specific useful lives. Likewise, when a major inspection is performed, its cost is recognised in the carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied. All other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in the statement of profit and loss as incurred. The present value of the expected cost for the decommissioning of an asset after its use is included in the cost of the respective asset if the recognition criteria for a provision are met. Refer note 40 regarding significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions and provisions for further information about the recorded decommissioning provision.

Leasehold land – amortised on a straight line basis over the period of the lease ranging from 95 years – 99 years.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside the statement of profit and loss is recognised outside the statement of profit and loss (either in other comprehensive income or in equity). Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity.

Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.

Sales/value added taxes paid on acquisition of assets or on incurring expenses

Expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales/value added taxes paid, except:

- When the tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case, the tax paid is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item, as applicable
- When receivables and payables are stated with the amount of tax included

The net amount of tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the balance sheet.

The management has estimated, supported by independent assessment by professional, the useful lives of the following class of assets.

- Factory buildings - 50 years (Higher than those indicated in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013)
- Plant & Machinery – 20 years (Higher than those indicated in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013)
- Moulds – 6 years (Lower than those indicated in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013)
- Electrical Installations – 20 years (Higher than those indicated in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013)
- Air conditioner having capacity of &gt; 2 tons – 15 years (Higher than those indicated in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013)
- Serviceable materials like trollies, iron storage tacks skids – 15 years (Higher than those indicated in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013)
- Batteries used in fork lifts trucks - 5 years (Lower than those indicated in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013)

The management believes that the depreciation rates fairly reflect its estimation of the useful lives and residual values of the fixed assets.

An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the income statement when the asset is derecognised.

Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the statement of profit or loss when the asset is derecognised.

Intangible assets are amortised on straight line method as under:

- Software expenditure have been amortised over a period of three years.

## ANNUAL REPORT 2016-17 235

## FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

### NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended March 31, 2017

Technical Know-how and Brands are amortised over period in which they occur. Borrowing costs consist of a period of twenty years.

Technical know-how and Brand

The Group has originally generated technical know-how and assistance for setting up of Halol radial plant. Considering the life of the underlying plant/facility, this technical know-how is amortised on a straight line basis over a period of twenty years.

The Group has acquired global rights of “CEAT” brand from the Italian tyre maker, Pirelli. Prior to the said acquisition, the Group was the owner of the brand in only a few Asian countries including India. With the acquisition of the brand which is renowned worldwide, new and hitherto unexplored markets will be accessible to the Group. The Group will be in a position to fully exploit the export market resulting in increased volume and better price realization. Therefore, the management believes that the Brand will yield significant benefits for a period of at least twenty years.

Research and development costs

Research costs are expensed as incurred. Development expenditures on an individual project are recognised as an intangible asset when the Group can demonstrate:

- The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that the asset will be available for use or sale
- Its intention to complete and its ability and intention to use or sell the asset
- How the asset will generate future economic benefits
- The availability of resources to complete the asset
- The ability to measure reliably the expenditure during development

Following initial recognition of the development expenditure as an asset, the asset is carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Amortization of the asset begins when development is complete and the asset is available for use. It is amortised over the period of expected future benefit. Amortization expense is recognised in the statement of profit and loss unless such expenditure forms part of carrying value of another asset. During the period of development, the asset is tested for impairment annually.

### 12. Borrowing costs

Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the

### 13. Leases

The determination of whether an arrangement is (or contains) a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at the inception of the lease. The arrangement is, or contains, a lease if fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets and the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset or assets, even if that right is not explicitly specified in an arrangement.

For arrangements entered into prior to April 1, 2015, the group has determined whether the arrangement contains a lease on the basis of facts and circumstances existing on the date of transition.

Group as a lessee

Finance lease

A lease is classified at the inception date as a finance lease or an operating lease. A lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership to the Group is classified as a finance lease.

Finance leases are capitalised at the commencement of the lease at fair value of the leased property at the inception date or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are recognised in finance costs in the statement of profit and loss, unless they are directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they

### Operating lease

Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the statement of profit and loss on a straight line basis unless payments to the lessor are structured to increase in line with expected general inflation to compensate for the lessor’s expected inflationary cost increase.

### Group as a lessor

Finance lease

There are no finance leases where the Group is a lessor.

### Impairment of non-financial assets

The Group assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s (CGU) fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. Recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. When the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.

### Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.

Costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and conditions are accounted for as follows:

- Raw materials, components, stores and spares are valued at lower of cost and net realizable value. However, materials and other items held for use in the production of inventories are not written down below cost if the finished products in which they will be incorporated are expected to be sold at or above cost. Cost is determined on a weighted average basis. Cost of raw material is net of duty benefits under Duty Entitlement Exemption Certificate (DEEC) scheme.
- Work-in-progress and finished goods are valued at lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost includes direct materials and labour and a proportion.

### Net realisable value

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

### Initial cost of inventories

Initial cost of inventories includes the transfer of gains and losses on qualifying cash flow hedges, recognised in other comprehensive income, in respect of the purchases of raw materials.

### Traded goods

Traded goods are valued at lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost includes cost of purchase and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost is determined on a weighted average basis.

### Cost of finished goods

Cost of finished goods includes excise duty. Cost is determined on a weighted average basis.

### Depreciation of leased assets

A leased asset is depreciated over the useful life of the asset. However, if there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset is depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term.

### Contingent rentals

## Contingent rentals are recognised as expenses in the periods in which they are incurred.

### NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended March 31, 2017

and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth year. To estimate cash flow projections beyond periods covered by the most recent budgets/forecasts, the Group extrapolates cash flow projections in the budget using a steady or declining growth rate for subsequent years, unless an increasing rate can be justified. In any case, this growth rate does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the products, industries, or country or countries in which the entity operates, or for the market in which the asset is used.

Impairment losses of continuing operations, including impairment on inventories, are recognized in the statement of profit and loss.

## An assessment is made at each reporting date to determine whether there is an indication that previously recognized impairment losses no longer exist or have decreased. If such indication exists, the Group estimates the asset’s or CGU’s recoverable amount. A previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor

in net interest on the net defined benefit liability and the return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability), are recognised immediately in the balance sheet with a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through OCI in the period in which they occur. Remeasurement is not reclassified to the statement of profit and loss in subsequent periods.

Past service costs are recognised in the statement of profit and loss on the earlier of:

- The date of the plan amendment or curtailment and
- The date that the Group recognises related restructuring costs

Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset. The Group recognises the following changes in the net defined benefit obligation as an expense in the statement of profit and loss:

- Service costs comprising current service costs, past-service costs, gains and losses on curtailments and non-routine settlements; and
- Net interest expense or income

Compensated absences

Accumulated leave, which is expected to be utilized within the next 12 months, is treated as short-term employee benefit and this is shown under short term provision in the Balance Sheet. The Group measures the expected cost of such absences as the additional amount that it expects to pay as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the reporting date.

The Group treats accumulated leave expected to be carried forward beyond twelve months, as long-term employee benefit for measurement purposes and this is shown under long term provisions in the Balance Sheet.

Such long-term compensated absences are provided for based on the actuarial valuation using the projected unit credit method at the year-end. Actuarial gains/losses are immediately taken to the Statement of Profit and Loss and are not deferred. The Group presents the leave as a current liability in the balance sheet, to the extent it does not have an unconditional right to defer its settlement for 12 months after the reporting date. Where the Group has the unconditional legal and contractual right to defer the settlement for a period beyond 12 months, the same is presented as non-current liability.

Termination benefits

The Group recognizes termination benefit as a liability and an expense when the Group has a present obligation as a result of past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the termination benefit falls due for more than 12 months after the balance sheet date, they are measured at present value of the future cash flows using the discount rate determined by reference to market yields at the balance sheet date on the government bonds.

Financial instruments

A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.

Financial assets

Initial recognition and measurement

All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value through profit and loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset.

Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.

Subsequent measurement

For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in four categories:

- Debt instruments at amortised cost
- Debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI)
- Debt instruments, derivatives and equity instruments at fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL)
- Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI)

Debt instruments at amortised cost

A ‘debt instrument’ is measured at the amortised cost if both the following conditions are met:

a) The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash flows, and

b) Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.

A ‘debt instrument’ is classified as at pe FVTOCI if bop of pe following criteria are met:
a) The objective of pe business model is achieved bop by collecting contractual cash flows and selling pe financial assets, and
b) The asset’s contractual cash flows represent SPPI.
Debt instruments included wipin pe FVTOCI category are measured initially as well as at each reporting date at fair value. Fair value movements are recognized in pe oper comprehensive income (OCI). However, pe group recognizes interest income, impairment losses & reversals and foreign exchange gain or loss in pe statement of profit and loss. On derecognition of pe asset, cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from pe equity to pe statement of profit and loss. Interest earned whilst holding FVTOCI debt instrument is reported as interest income using pe Effective Interest Rate (EIR) mepod.

Debt instrument at FVTPL FVTPL is a residual category for debt instruments. Any debt instrument, which does not meet the criteria for categorization as at amortized cost or as FVTOCI, is classified as at FVTPL. In addition, the Group may elect to designate a debt instrument, which otherwise meets amortized cost or FVTOCI criteria, as at FVTPL. However, such election is allowed only if doing so reduces or eliminates a measurement or recognition inconsistency (referred to as ‘accounting mismatch’). The Group has not designated any debt instrument as at FVTPL.

Derecognition
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is primarily derecognised when:

- The rights to receive cash flows from pe asset have expired or
- The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from pe asset or has assumed an obligation to pay pe received cash flows in full wipout material delay to a pird party under a ‘pass-prough’ arrangement, and eiper (a) pe Group has transferred substantially all pe risks and rewards of pe asset, or (b) pe Group has neiper transferred nor retained substantially all pe risks and rewards of pe asset, but has transferred control of pe asset.

Debt instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the statement of profit and loss.

When the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the Group continues to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of the Group’s continuing involvement. In that case, the Group also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Group has retained.

Continuing involvement that takes the form of a Lifetime ECL are the expected credit losses resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument. The 12-month ECL is a portion of the lifetime ECL which results from default events that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date.

Impairment of financial assets

In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Group applies expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss on the following financial assets and credit risk exposure:

- Financial assets that are debt instruments, and are measured at amortised cost e.g., loans, debt securities, deposits, trade receivables and bank balance
- Financial assets that are debt instruments and are measured as at FVTOCI
- Lease receivables under Ind AS 17
- Trade receivables or any contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset that result from transactions that are within the scope of Ind AS 18
- Loan commitments which are not measured as at FVTPL

The Group follows ‘simplified approach’ for recognition of impairment loss allowance on:

- Trade receivables
- All lease receivables resulting from transactions within the scope of Ind AS 17

The application of simplified approach does not require the Group to track changes in credit risk. Rather, it recognises impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date, right from its initial recognition.

For recognition of impairment loss on other financial assets and risk exposure, the group determines that whether there has been a significant increase in the credit risk since initial recognition. If credit risk has not increased significantly, 12-month ECL is used to provide for impairment loss. However, if credit risk has increased significantly, lifetime ECL is used. If, in a subsequent period, credit quality of the instrument improves such that there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, then the entity reverts to recognizing impairment loss allowance based on 12-month ECL.

ECL impairment loss allowance (or reversal) recognized during the period is recognized as income/ expense in the statement of profit and loss (P&L). This amount is reflected under the head ‘other expenses’ in the statement of profit and loss. The balance sheet presentation for various financial instruments is described below:

- Financial assets measured as at amortised cost, contractual revenue receivables and lease receivables: ECL is presented as an allowance, i.e., as an integral part of the measurement of those assets in the balance sheet. The allowance reduces the net carrying amount. Until the asset meets write-off criteria, the Group does not reduce impairment allowance from the gross carrying amount.
- Debt instruments measured at FVTOCI: Since financial assets are already reflected at fair value, impairment allowance is not further reduced from its value.

For assessing increase in credit risk and impairment loss, transferred to the statement of profit and loss. However, the Group combines financial instruments on the basis of shared credit risk characteristics with the objective of facilitating an analysis that is designed to enable significant increases in credit risk to be identified on a timely basis. The Group does not have any purchased or originated credit-impaired (POCI) financial assets, i.e., financial assets which are credit impaired on purchase/ origination.

Financial liabilities

Initial recognition and measurement

Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.

All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs. The Group’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings including bank overdrafts and derivative financial instruments.

Subsequent measurement

The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below:

Financial liabilities at fair value prough profit and loss
Financial liabilities at fair value prough profit and loss include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value prough profit and loss. Financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if pey are incurred for pe purpose of repurchasing in pe near term. This category also includes derivative financial instruments entered into by pe group pat are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by Ind AS 109.

Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

Financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit and loss are designated as such at the initial date of recognition, and only if the criteria in Ind AS 109 are satisfied. For liabilities designated as FVTPL, fair value gains/ losses attributable to changes in own credit risks are recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI). These gains/ loss are not subsequently.

transferred to the statement of profit and loss. However, the Group may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity. All other changes in fair value of such liability are recognised in the statement of profit and loss. The Group has not designated any financial liability as at fair value through profit and loss.

Loans and borrowings

This is the category most relevant to the Group. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the Effective Interest Rate(EIR) method. Gains and losses are recognised in the statement profit and loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process.

Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the statement of profit and loss.

Derecognition

A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

Reclassification of financial assets

The Group determines classification of financial assets and liabilities on initial recognition. After initial recognition, no reclassification is made for financial assets which are equity instruments and financial liabilities. For financial assets which are debt instruments, a reclassification is made only if there is a change in the business model for managing those assets. Changes to the business model are expected to be infrequent. The Group’s senior management determines change in the business model as a result of external or internal changes which are significant to the Group’s operations. Such changes are evident to external parties. A change in the business model occurs when the Group either begins or ceases to perform an activity that is significant to its operations. If the Group reclassifies financial assets, it applies the reclassification prospectively from the reclassification date which is the first day of the immediately next reporting period following the change in business model. The Group does not restate any previously recognised gains, losses (including impairment gains or losses) or interest.

Offsetting of financial instruments: Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.

Derivative financial instruments: The Group uses derivative financial instruments, such as forward currency contracts, to manage its foreign currency risks. These derivative instruments are not designated as cash flow, fair value or net investment hedges and are entered into for period consistent with currency. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative. Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives are taken directly to the statement of profit and loss.

Fair value hedges: The change in the fair value of a hedging instrument is recognised in the statement of profit and loss as finance costs. The change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk hedged is recorded as part of the carrying value of the hedged item and is also recognised in the statement of profit and loss as finance costs.

Cash flow hedges: The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income (OCI) in the cash flow hedge reserve, while any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the statement of profit and loss.

## The Group uses forward currency contracts as hedges of its exposure to foreign currency risk in forecast transactions and firm commitments. The ineffective portion relating to foreign currency contracts is recognised in other income/other expenses.

## FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

### NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended March 31, 2017

Amounts recognised as OCI are transferred to the statement of profit and loss when the hedged transaction affects profit and loss, such as when the hedged financial income or financial expense is recognised or when a forecast sale occurs. When the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability, the amounts recognised as OCI are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability.

If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover (as part of the hedging strategy), or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, or when the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI remains separately in equity until the forecast transaction occurs or the foreign currency firm commitment is met.

### 20. Fair value measurement

The Group measures financial instruments, such as derivatives, foreign denominated borrowings and assets, forward contracts at fair value at each balance sheet date.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:

- In the principal market for the asset or liability
- In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability

The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Group.

The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.

A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.

The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:

- Level 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
- Level 2 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable
- Level 3 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable

For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.

For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above.

### 21. Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks and on hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less, which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.

For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term deposits, as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts as they are considered an integral part of the Group’s cash management.

### 22. Dividend distribution to equity holders

The Group recognises a liability to make cash distributions to equity holders of the Group when the distribution is authorised and the distribution is no longer at the discretion of the Group. As per the corporate laws in India, a distribution is authorised when it is approved by the shareholders. A corresponding amount is recognised directly in equity.

23. Foreign currencies

The Group’s financial statements are presented in €, which is also pe Group’s functional currency.

Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by pe Group at € spot rate at pe date pe transaction first qualifies for recognition. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at pe functional currency spot rates of exchange at pe reporting date.

Exchange differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognised in pe statement of profit and loss.

Non-monetary items pat are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using pe exchange rates at pe dates of pe initial transactions.

Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using pe exchange rates at pe date when pe fair value is determined. The gain or loss arising on translation of non-monetary items measured at fair value is treated in line wip pe recognition of pe gain or loss on pe change in fair value of pe item (i.e., translation differences on items whose fair value gain or loss is recognised in OCI or pe statement of profit and loss are also recognised in OCI or pe statement of profit and loss, respectively).

On consolidation, pe assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into € at pe rate of exchange prevailing at pe reporting date and peir statements of profit and loss are translated at exchange rates prevailing at pe dates of pe transactions. For practical reasons, pe group uses a weighted average weekly rates to translate income and expense items, if pe average rate approximates pe exchange rates at pe dates of pe transactions. The exchange differences arising on translation for consolidation are recognised in OCI. On disposal of a foreign operation, pe component of OCI relating to pat particular foreign operation is reclassified in statement of profit and loss.

24. Earnings Per Share

Basic Earnings per share (EPS) amounts are calculated by dividing pe profit for pe year attributable to equity holders by pe weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during pe year.

Diluted EPS amounts are calculated by dividing pe profit attributable to equity holders by pe weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during pe year plus pe weighted average number of equity shares pat would be issued on conversion of all pe dilutive potential equity shares into equity shares.

25. Segment reporting

Based on "Management Approach" as defined in Ind AS 108 -Operating Segments, pe Executive Management Committee evaluates pe Group's performance and allocates pe resources based on an analysis of various performance indicators by business segments.

Segment Policies

The Group prepares its segment information in conformity wip pe accounting policies adopted for preparing and presenting pe financial statements of pe Company as a whole.

26. Contingent liability and contingent assets

Contingent liability is a possible obligation pat arises from past events whose existence will be confirmed by pe occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly wipin pe control of pe Group or a present obligation pat is not recognized because it is not probable pat an outflow of resources will be required to settle pe obligation. A contingent liability also arises in extremely rare cases where pere is a liability pat cannot be recognized because it cannot be measured reliably. The Group does not recognize a contingent liability but discloses its existence in pe financial statements. A contingent assets is not recognized unless it becomes virtually certain pat an inflow of economic benefits will arise. When an inflow of economic benefits is probable, contingent assets are disclosed in pe financial statements. Contingent liabilities and contingent assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date.

1. In an earlier year, the Company has acquired global rights of “CEAT” brand from the Italian tyre maker, Pirelli. Prior to the said acquisition, the Company was the owner of the brand in only a few Asian countries including India. With the acquisition of the brand which is renowned worldwide, new and hitherto unexplored markets are accessible to the Company. The Company will be in a position to fully exploit the export market resulting in increased volume and price realization. Therefore, the management believes that the Brand will yield significant benefits for a period of at least twenty years.

2. The Company has acquired technical know-how and assistance from International Tire Engineering Resources LLC, for setting up for Halol radial plant. Considering the life of the underlying plant / facility, this technical know-how, is amortized on a straight line basis over a period of twenty years.

The Group offsets tax assets and liabilities if and only if it has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets and current tax liabilities and the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities related to income taxes levied by the same tax authority.

At March 31, 2017, there was no recognised deferred tax liability (March 31, 2016: `NIL and April 1, 2015:` NIL) for taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of the Group’s subsidiaries. The Group has determined that undistributed profits of its subsidiaries will not be distributed in the foreseeable future.

However as at March 31, 2017, deferred tax liability of `1,300.52 lacs (March 31, 2016: `1,183.70 lacs, April 1, 2015: `931.47 lacs) in respect of temporary differences related to an investment in joint venture which has been recognized because the Group doesn’t control the dividend policy of its joint venture i.e. the Group doesn’t controls the timing of reversal of the related taxable temporary differences and management is satisfied that they will reverse in the foreseeable future.

## FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

### NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended March 31, 2017

Note 40: Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions

The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require an adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities in future periods. Difference between actual results and estimates are recognised in the periods in which the results are known / materialised.

Judgements

In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made the following judgements, which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements.

Estimates and assumptions

The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation of uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are described below. The Group has based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the financial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances arising that are beyond the control of the Group. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.

a) Taxes

Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the losses can be utilised. Significant management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies.

Uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of complex tax regulations and the amount and timing of future taxable income. Given the wide range of business relationships and the long-term nature and complexity of existing contractual agreements, differences arising between the actual results and the assumptions made, or future changes to such assumptions, could necessitate future adjustments to tax income and expense already recorded. The Group establishes provisions, based on reasonable estimates, for possible consequences of audits by the tax authorities of the respective countries.

b) Defined benefit plans

The Group’s obligation on account of present value (PV) of gratuity and compensated absences are determined based on actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, these liabilities are highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.

The parameter most subject to change is the discount rate. In determining the appropriate discount rate, the management considers the interest rates of government bonds in currencies consistent with the currencies of the post-employment benefit obligation.

The mortality rate is based on publicly available mortality tables. Those mortality tables tend to change only at interval in response to demographic changes. Future salary increases and gratuity increases are based on expected future inflation rates.

c) Provision for decommissioning

The Group has recognised a provision for decommissioning obligations associated with a land taken on lease at Nashik manufacturing facility. In determining the fair value of the provision, assumptions and estimates are made in relation to discount rates, the expected cost to dismantle and remove the plant from the site and the expected timing of those costs. The carrying amount of the provision as at March 31, 2017 was `54.69 lacs (March 31, 2016: `49.06 lacs, April 1, 2015: `44.00 lacs). The Group estimates that the costs would be realised in year 2066 at the expiration of the

lease and calculates the provision using the discounted cash flow (DCF) method based on the following assumptions:

- Estimated range of cost per square meter – `45 – `50
- Discount rate – 11.50%

Provision for warranty

The estimated liability for warranty is recorded when products are sold. These estimates are established using historical information on the nature, frequency and average cost of obligations and management estimates regarding possible future incidence based on corrective actions on product failure. The timing of outflows will vary as and when the obligation will arise - being typically up to three years. The rate used for discounting warranty provisions is 11.50%.

Fair value measurement of financial instruments

When the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques including the Discounted Cash Flow model. The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values. Judgements include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments. See Note 49 and 50 for further disclosures.

Classification of Joint arrangement

Associated Ceat Holdings Company (Pvt.) Ltd. (100% owned ‘subsidiary’) has a 50% interest in a joint arrangement called the CEAT Kelani Holding Company Pvt. Limited which was set up as a partnership together with Kelani Tyres Limited. The principal place of business of the joint operation is in Sri Lanka.

The Group considers that such arrangement is a joint venture, as the agreement in relation to the CEAT Kelani Holding Company Pvt. Limited requires unanimous consent from both parties for all relevant activities. The two partners have direct rights to the assets of the partnership and are jointly and severally liable for the liabilities incurred by the partnership. This entity is therefore classified as a joint venture and is consolidated using the equity method.

b) Defined benefit plan - Gratuity

The fund has the form of a trust and it is governed by the Board of Trustees, which consists of employer and employee representatives. The Board of Trustees is responsible for the administration of the plan assets and for the definition of the investment strategy.

Each year, the Board of Trustees reviews the level of funding. Such a review includes the asset-liability matching strategy and investment risk management policy. This includes employing the use of annuities and longevity swaps to manage the risks. The Board of Trustees decides its contribution based on the results

The gratuity plan is governed by the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. Under the act, every employee who has completed five years of service gets a gratuity on separation @ 15 days of last drawn salary for each completed year of service. The scheme is funded with an insurance company in the form of qualifying insurance policy.

### The principal assumptions used in determining gratuity and leave encashment for the Group’s plan are shown below

Description of Risk Exposures: Valuations are performed on certain basic set of predetermined assumptions and other regulatory framework which may vary overtime. Thus, the Group is exposed to various risks in providing the above gratuity benefit which are as follows:

Interest Rate risk: The plan exposes the Group to the risk of change in interest rates. A fall in interest rates will result in an increase in the ultimate cost of providing the above benefit and will thus result in an increase in the value of the liability (as shown in financial statements).

Liquidity risk: This is the risk that the Company is not able to meet the short-term gratuity payouts. This may arise due to non-availability of enough cash/cash equivalent to meet the liabilities or holding of illiquid assets not being sold in time.

Salary escalation risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan is calculated with the assumption of salary increase rate of plan participants in the future. Deviation in the rate of increase of salary in the future for plan participants from the rate of increase in salary used to determine the present value of obligation will have a bearing on the plan’s liability.

Demographic risk: The Company has used certain mortality and attrition assumptions in valuation of the liability. The Company is exposed to the risk of actual

for the year ended March 31, 2017

experience turning out to be worse compared to the higher gratuity payouts (e.g. Increase in the maximum limit on gratuity of ` 10.00 lacs).

Regulatory risk: Gratuity benefit is paid in accordance with the requirements of the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 (as amended from time to time). There is a risk of change in regulations requiring occurrence of losses relative to the expected return on any particular investment.

Asset liability mismatching or market risk: The duration of the liability is longer compared to duration of assets, exposing the Company to market risk for volatilities/fall in interest rate.

Investment risk: The probability or likelihood of

### NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended March 31, 2017

The sensitivity analyses above have been determined based on a method that extrapolates the impact on defined benefit obligation as a result of reasonable changes in key assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period. Any deficit in the assets arising as a result of such valuation is funded by the Company. The Company’s best estimate of contribution during the next year is ` 1,582.13 Lacs.

1. The Company has been served with a Show Cause cum Demand Notice from the DGCEI (Directorate of Central Excise Intelligence) Mumbai, on the ground that, the activity of making tyre set, i.e. inserting Tubes and Flaps inside the Tyres and tied up through Polypropylene Straps, amounts to manufacture / pre-packaged commodity under Section 2(f)(iii) of Central Excise Act, read with Section 2(l) of the Legal Metrology Act, 2009. Accordingly, the authorities worked out the differential duty amounting to `8,655.63 lacs i.e., the amount of duty already paid on the basis of transaction value and duty payable on the basis of MRP under Section 4A, for the period from April-2011 to April-2015.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

for the year ended March 31, 2017

1. The Company has a strong case on the ground that, they said issue has been clarified by the Controller of the Legal Metrology Department vide its letter dated May 1, 1991 that “Tyre with tube & flaps tied with three thin polythene strips may not be treated as a pre-packed commodity within the meaning of rule 2(l) of the Standards of Weights and Measures (Packaged Commodities), Rules, 1977”. The above clarification has been re-affirmed vide letter dated November 16, 1992 by the Legal Metrology authorities.

2. The Competition Commission of India (CCI) had, while considering the representation made by All India Tyres Dealers Federation (AITDF) made a prima facie view that the major players of tyre industry (including the Company) had some understanding amongst themselves, especially in the replacement market, as they did not pass the benefit of corresponding reduction in prices of major raw material inputs for the period subsequent to the year 2011-12. According to CCI, this practice is in violation of the Competition Act 2002 (the Act). Therefore, CCI had, vide its order passed on June 24, 2014 under Section 26(1) of the Act, directed the Office of the Director General (DG) to investigate the said alleged violation of the Act. DG submitted its Investigation Report to CCI in December 2015, based on which CCI passed an order on February 18, 2016 directing the said tyre manufacturers to file their suggestions/objections by May 5, 2016. Objections were filed as directed and the CCI had also heard the tyre manufacturers in detail. The case was last posted on December, 2016 and is now reserved for Orders. The Company’s decision to change the price is purely a business decision which depends upon many factors like cost of production, brand value perception and profit margin of each product, quality perception of each product in the market, demand and supply situation of each product category and market potential and market shares targets of various product categories etc. In view of the above, Company believes that it has a strong case.

current borrowing and other current financial assets and

liabilities (except derivative financial instrument those being

measured at fair value through other comprehensive income)

approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-

term maturities of these instruments.

The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities is included

at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged

in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in

a forced or liquidation sale. The foreign exchange forward

contracts used for hedging the recognized import trade

payables / export trade receivables have been valued based

on the closing spot. The following methods and assumptions

were used to estimate the fair values:

These values are close estimations of the fair values which could be realised on immediate winding up of the deals. The swap

contracts and the option contracts have been valued at the market realisable values obtained from the counterparty and the same

have been valued using the swap valuation / option valuation, based on present value calculations.

Note 51 : Financial risk management objectives

The analyses exclude the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying values of gratuity and other post-retirement obligations and provisions.

The Group’s principal financial liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise loans and borrowings, trade and other payables. The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Group’s operations. The Group’s principal financial assets include trade and other receivables, mutual fund investments, and cash and cash equivalents that derive directly from its operations. The Group also enters into derivative transactions.

The Group’s financial risk activities are governed by appropriate policies and procedures and that financial risks are identified, measured and managed in accordance with the Group’s policies and risk objectives. All derivative activities for risk management purposes are carried out by specialist teams that have the appropriate skills, experience and supervision. The Board of Directors through its Risk Management Committee reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.

a. Market risk

Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk, such as equity price risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk include loans and borrowings, deposits, investments and derivative financial instruments.

The sensitivity analyses in the following sections relate to the position as at March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016.

The sensitivity analyses have been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and derivatives and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant and on the basis of hedge designations in place at March 31, 2017.

b. Interest rate risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s long-term debt obligations with floating interest rates.

The Group manages its interest rate risk by having a balanced portfolio of fixed and variable rate loans and borrowings. To manage this, the Group enters into interest rate swaps, in which it agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. At March 31, 2017, after taking into account the effect of interest rate swaps, approximately 49% of the Group’s long term borrowings are at a fixed rate of interest (March 31, 2016: 49%).

Foreign currency risk

Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to the Group’s operating activities (when revenue or expense is denominated in a foreign currency) and the Group’s net investments in foreign subsidiaries.

The Group manages its foreign currency risk by hedging transactions that are expected to occur within a maximum 6-month period for the foreign currency denominated trade payables and trade receivables. The foreign currency risk on the foreign currency loans are mitigated by entering into Cross Currency Swaps.

At March 31, 2017, the Group hedged 95% (March 31, 2016: 100%, April 1, 2015: 100 %), of its foreign currency loans. This foreign currency risk is hedged by using foreign currency forward contracts. At March 31, 2017, the Group hedged 98% (March 31, 2016: 86%) of its foreign currency receivables/payables.

Commodity price risk

The Group is affected by the price volatility of certain commodities. Its operating activities require the ongoing purchase of rubber and carbon black and therefore require a continuous supply of rubber and carbon black. Due to the significantly increased volatility of the price of rubber and carbon black, the Group also entered into various purchase contracts for rubber and carbon black (for which there is an active market).

## The Group’s Board of Directors has developed and enacted a risk management strategy regarding commodity price risk and its mitigation.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended March 31, 2017

Commodity price sensitivity

The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 5% movement in the input price of rubber and carbon black. The sensitivity analysis includes only 5% change in commodity prices for quantity sold or consumed during the year, with all other variables held constant.

Equity price risk

The Group invests its surplus funds in various debt instruments and debt mutual funds. These comprise mainly of liquid schemes of mutual funds (liquid investments) and fixed deposits.

Mutual fund investments are susceptible to market price risk, mainly arising from changes in the interest rates or market yields which may impact the return and value of such investments. However, due to the very short tenor of the underlying portfolio in the liquid schemes, these do not pose any significant price risk.

There is no material equity risk relating to the Group’s equity investments which are detailed in note 5. The Group equity investments majorly comprise of strategic investments rather than trading purposes.

Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk that counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss. The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables) and from its financing activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions, foreign exchange transactions, and other financial instruments.

Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are generally on 30 days to 90 days credit term. Credit limits are established for all customers based on internal rating criteria. Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored. Credit risk on receivables is also mitigated by securing the same against security deposit, letter of credit, and advance payment.

An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date on an individual basis for major clients. In addition, a large number of minor receivables are grouped into homogenous groups and assessed for impairment collectively. The Group does not hold collateral as security. The Group has no concentration of credit risk as the customer base is widely distributed both economically and geographically.

<h>Excessive risk concentration</h>
Concentrations arise when a number of counterparties are engaged in similar business activities, or activities in the same geographical region, or have economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic, political or other conditions. Concentrations indicate the relative sensitivity of the Group’s performance to developments affecting a particular industry.

In order to avoid excessive concentrations of risk, the Group’s policies and procedures include specific guidelines to focus on the maintenance of a diversified portfolio. Identified concentrations of credit risks are controlled and managed accordingly. Selective hedging is used within the Group to manage risk concentrations at both the relationship and industry levels.

Collateral: The Company has hypothecated the entire current assets to its consortium of bankers. The term lenders also have a second charge on the varied current assets.

#### Note 52: Capital management

For the purpose of the Group capital management, capital includes issued equity capital, convertible preference shares, share premium and all other equity reserves attributable to the equity holders of the Company. The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to maximise the shareholder value.

The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments in light of changes in economic conditions and the requirements of the financial covenants. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares. The Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is net debt divided by total capital plus net debt. The Group includes within net debt, interest bearing loans and borrowings, trade and other payables, less cash and cash equivalents.

The Group’s capital management, amongst other things, aims to ensure that it meets financial covenants attached to the interest-bearing loans and borrowings that define capital structure requirements. Breaches in meeting the financial covenants would permit the bank to immediately call loans and borrowings. There have been no breaches in the financial covenants of any interest-bearing loans and borrowing in the current period.

No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes for managing capital during the years ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016.

and including the year ended March 31, 2016. The Group has prepared its first Ind AS (Indian Accounting Standards) compliant Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2017 with restated comparative figures for the year ended March 31, 2016 in compliance with Ind AS. Accordingly, the Opening Balance Sheet, in line with Ind AS transitional provisions, has been prepared as at April 1, 2015, the date of Group’s transition to Ind AS. The principal adjustments made by the Group in restating its Indian GAAP financial statements for the financial year ending March 31, 2016 and the Balance Sheet as at April 1, 2015 are as mentioned below:

Exemptions applied

Ind AS 101 on First Time Adoption of Ind AS allows first-time adopters certain exemptions from the retrospective application of certain requirements under Ind AS. The Group has applied the following exemptions:

- Ind AS 103 Business Combinations has not been applied to acquisitions of subsidiaries, which are considered businesses under Ind AS that occurred before April 1, 2015. Use of this exemption means that the Indian GAAP carrying amounts of assets and liabilities, that are required to be recognised under Ind AS, is their deemed cost at the date of the acquisition. After the date of the acquisition, measurement is in accordance with respective Ind AS. The group recognises all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a past business combination, except (i) certain financial assets and liabilities that were derecognised and that fall under the de-recognition exception, and (ii) assets (including goodwill) and liabilities that were not recognised in the acquirer’s consolidated balance sheet under its previous GAAP and that would not qualify for recognition under Ind AS in the individual balance sheet of the acquiree. Assets and liabilities that do not qualify for recognition under Ind AS are excluded from the opening Ind AS balance sheet. The Group did not recognise or exclude any previously recognised amounts as a result of Ind AS recognition requirements.
- The group has used same exemptions for interest in joint ventures.
- There is no change in the functional currency of the Group and accordingly, it has elected to continue with the carrying values for all of its property, plant and equipment as recognised in its Indian GAAP financial statements as the deemed cost at the transition date subject to the adjustments for decommissioning liabilities. As per the exemption under Ind AS 101, decommissioning liability was measured in accordance with Ind AS 37 at the date of transition to Ind AS. To the extent the liability was within the scope of Appendix-A of Ind AS 16, estimated liability that would have been included in the cost of related asset was discounted by using best estimate of the historical risk adjusted discount rate over the intervening period. Accumulated depreciation was calculated on that amount as at the date of transition to Ind AS on the basis of the current estimate of the useful life of the asset using the depreciation policy adopted by the Group in accordance with Ind AS.
- The Group has elected to use the previous GAAP carrying values as deemed cost at the transition date for all its intangible assets.
- Appendix C to Ind AS 17 requires the Company to assess whether a contract or arrangement contains a lease. In accordance with Ind AS 17, this assessment should be carried out at the inception of the contract or arrangement. However, the Group has used Ind AS 101 exemption and assessed all relevant arrangements for leases based on conditions in place as at the date of transition.
- Cumulative currency translation differences for all foreign operations are deemed to be zero as at April 1, 2015.
- The Group has a 50% interest in a joint arrangement called the CEAT Kelani Holding Company Pvt. Limited which was set up as a partnership together with Kelani Tyres Limited. Under Indian-GAAP group has proportionately consolidated its interest in the CEAT Kelani Holding Company Pvt. Limited in the Consolidated Financial Statement. On transition to Ind AS the group has assessed and determined that CEAT Kelani Holding Company Pvt. Limited is its joint venture under Ind AS 111 Joint Arrangements. Therefore, it needs to be accounted for using the equity method as against proportionate consolidation. For the application of equity method, the initial investment is measured as the aggregate of carrying amount of assets and liabilities that the group had previously proportionately consolidated.

Exceptions applied

Ind AS 101 specifies mandatory exceptions from retrospective application of certain requirements under Ind AS for first-time adopters. Following exceptions are applicable to the Group :

1. Use of Estimates
   The estimates at April 1, 2015 and March 31, 2016 are consistent with those made for the same dates in accordance with Indian GAAP (after adjustments to reflect any differences in accounting policies) apart from the following items where application of Indian GAAP did not require estimation:

### II. Impairment of financial assets

The Group has applied the exception related impairment of financial assets given in Ind AS 101. It has used reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort to determine the credit risk at the date that financial assets were initially recognised and compared that to the credit risk as at April 1, 2015.

### III. Government Loans

The Group has applied the exception related to government loans (i.e. sales tax deferral scheme) existing at the date of transition to Ind AS and it has used its previous GAAP carrying amount of the loan at the date of transition to Ind AS the carrying amount of the loan in the opening Ind AS statement of financial position.

### IV. De-recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities

The Group has elected to apply the de-recognition requirements for financial assets and financial liabilities in Ind AS 109 prospectively for transactions occurring on or after the transition to Ind AS.

### V. Classification and measurement of financial assets

## The Group has classified the financial assets in accordance to Ind AS 109 on the basis of the facts and circumstances that exist on the date of transition to Ind AS.

### NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

for the year ended March 31, 2017

Footnotes to the reconciliation of equity as at April 1, 2015 and March 31, 2016 and profit or loss for the period ended relate, irrespective of when they are declared. Under Ind AS, a proposed dividend is recognised as a liability in the period in which it is declared by the Group (usually when approved by shareholders in a general meeting) or paid.

1. Joint Venture

The Group holds 50% interest in CEAT Kelani Holding Company Pvt. Limited and exercises joint control over pe entity. Under Indian-GAAP group has proportionately consolidated its interest in CEAT Kelani Holding Company Pvt. Limited in pe Consolidated Financial Statement. On transition to Ind AS pe group has assessed and determined pat CEAT Kelani Holding Company Pvt. Limited is its joint venture under Ind AS 111 Joint Arrangements. Therefore, it needs to be accounted for using pe equity mepod as against proportionate consolidation. For pe application of equity mepod, pe initial investment is measured as pe aggregate of Ind AS amount of assets and liabilities pat pe group had previously proportionately consolidated including any goodwill arising on acquisition. On application of equity mepod pe investment stands increased by `13,053.27 lacs on April 1, 2015 and by` 15,513.58 lacs on March 31, 2016. De-recognition of proportionately consolidated CEAT Kelani Holding Company Pvt. Limited has resulted in change in balance sheet, statement of profit and loss and cash flow statement. For its impact on pe financial statement refer note 43.

2. Foreign Currency Translation

Under Indian GAAP, pe Group recognised translation differences on foreign operations in a separate component of equity. Under Ind AS, Cumulative currency translation differences for all foreign operations are deemed to be zero as at April 1, 2015. The resulting adjustment of 1,002.19 lacs were recognised against retained earnings.

3. Decommissioning liability

Under Ind AS, provision for Decommissioning liability is measured at present value of pe expenditure expected to be incurred to settle pe obligation. ` 43.80 Lacs being pe present value of Decommissioning liability provision, net of depreciation effect has been adjusted and credited to retained earnings as on pe transition date.

4. Derivative instruments

The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts is recognised under Ind AS, which was not recognised under Indian GAAP. The corresponding adjustment of 16.51 lacs has been debited to Equity as on pe transition date.

5. Proposed Dividend

Under Indian GAAP, proposed dividends including DDT are recognised as a liability in pe period to which pey relate, irrespective of when pey are declared. Under Ind AS, a proposed dividend is recognised as a liability in pe period in which it is declared by pe Group (usually when approved by shareholders in a general meeting) or paid. In pe case of pe Group, pe declaration of dividend occurs after period end. Therefore, pe liability of ` 4,532.68 lacs for pe year ended on March 31, 2015 recorded for dividend has been derecognised against retained earnings on pe transition date.

6. Defined benefit liabilities

Both under Indian GAAP and Ind AS, the Group recognised costs related to its post-employment defined benefit plan on an actuarial basis. Under Indian GAAP, the entire cost, including actuarial gains and losses, are charged to the statement of profit and loss. Under Ind AS, re-measurements [comprising of actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling, excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability and the return on plan assets excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability are recognised immediately in the balance sheet with a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through other comprehensive income (OCI). Thus the employee benefit cost is decreased by ` 280.87 and re-measurement losses on defined benefit plans have been recognized in the OCI net of tax.

7. Provisions

Under Indian GAAP, the Group has accounted for provisions, including long-term provision, at the undiscounted amount. In contrast, Ind AS 37 requires that where the effect of time value of money is material, the amount of provision should be the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation. The discount rate(s) should not reflect risks for which future cash flow estimates have been adjusted. Ind AS 37 also provides that where discounting is used, the carrying amount of a provision increases in each period to reflect the passage of time. This increase is recognised as borrowing cost. This led to a decrease in provision on the date of transition by `194.25 lacs with corresponding impact on equity. In FY 2015-16, this led to increase in provision by` 7.92 lacs with a corresponding impact on revenue from sale of goods.

8. Deferred tax

Under Indian GAAP, deferred tax is accounted using the income statement approach as per timing differences between taxable profits and accounting profits for the period. Ind AS 12 requires accounting for deferred taxes using the balance sheet approach as per temporary

9. Borrowings
   Under Indian GAAP, unamortised transaction costs relating to borrowings is shown separately in assets, whereas under Ind AS such cost are netted off against pe borrowings. Hence as on pe transition date unamortised transaction cost of ` 273.99 lacs is netted off against pe borrowings.

10. Excise Duty and Cash Discount
    Excise duty of `66,236.76 lacs on account of sale of goods have been included in revenue as it is on own account because it is liability of pe manufacturer which forms part of pe production, irrespective of wheper goods are sold or not.
Under Indian GAAP, cash discount of` 4,283.37 lacs was recognised as part of oper expenses which has been adjusted against pe revenue under Ind AS during pe year ended March 31, 2016.

11. Oper comprehensive income
    Under Indian GAAP, pe Group has not presented oper comprehensive income (OCI) separately. Hence, it has reconciled Indian GAAP profit or loss to profit or profit or loss as per Ind AS. Furper, Indian GAAP profit or loss is reconciled to total comprehensive income as per Ind AS.

12. Government Grant
    Under Ind AS, when pe Group receives grants of non-monetary assets, pe asset and pe grant are recorded at fair value amounts and released to profit or loss over pe expected useful life in a pattern of consumption of pe benefit of pe underlying asset.

differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet and its tax base. The application of Ind AS 12 approach has resulted in recognition of deferred tax on new temporary differences which was not required under Indian GAAP. In addition, the various transitional adjustments lead to temporary differences as on the transition date.

Deferred tax liability in respect of temporary differences related to an investment in joint venture has been recognized because the Group doesn’t control the dividend policy of its joint venture i.e. the Group doesn’t controls the timing of reversal of the related taxable temporary differences and management is satisfied that they will reverse in the foreseeable future.

13 Statement of cash flows

The transition from Indian GAAP to Ind AS has not had a material impact on the statement of cash flows.

Note 55: Events after Balance sheet date

- The company has received orders for income tax refund amounting to ` 2,600 lacs for previous years in April 2017.
- The board has recommended dividend of ` 11.50 per share (previous year NIL) for financial year 2016-17.

Note 56: Standards issued but not yet effective

In March 2017, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs issued the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) (Amendments) Rules, 2017, notifying amendments to Ind AS 7, ‘Statement of Cash Flows’ and Ind AS, 102,’Share-based payment’. The amendments are applicable from April 1, 2017.

Amendment to Ind AS 7

The amendment to Ind AS 7 requires the entities to provide disclosures that enable users of financial statements to evaluate changes in liabilities arising from financing activities, including both changes arising from cash flows and non-cash changes, suggesting inclusion of a reconciliation between the opening and closing balances in the Balance Sheet for liabilities arising from financing activities, to meet the disclosure requirement. The Company is evaluating the requirements of the amendment and the effect on the financial statements is being evaluated.

Amendment to Ind AS 102

The amendment to Ind AS 102 provides specific guidance to measurement of cash-settled awards, modification of cash-settled awards and awards that include a net settlement feature in respect of withholding taxes. The requirements of the amendment have no impact on the financial statements as the standard is not applicable to the Company.
