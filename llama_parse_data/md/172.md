for the year ended March 31, 2016

Revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the group and revenue can be reliably measured. The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognized:

1. Sale of Goods: Revenue from sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership are passed on to the customer. Sales taxes and Value Added Taxes (VAT) are excluded from revenue.
2. Interest: Interest income is recognized on a time proportion basis taking into account the amount outstanding and the applicable interest rate. Interest income is included under the head “other income” in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
3. Dividends: Dividend income is recognized when the Company’s right to receive dividend is established by the reporting date.
4. Royalty and Technology Development fees: Royalty and Technology development fees income are accounted for as per the terms of contracts.

## Foreign Currency Translation

Foreign currency transactions and balances:

1. Initial recognition: Foreign currency transactions are recorded in the reporting currency by applying the exchange rate between the reporting currency and the foreign currency at the date of the transaction.
2. Conversion: Foreign currency monetary items are retranslated using the exchange rate prevailing at the reporting date. Non-monetary items are translated using the exchange rate at the date when such value was determined.
3. Exchange differences: The Company accounts for exchange differences arising on translation/settlement of foreign currency monetary items as per specific guidelines.

### Government Grants and Export Incentives

Government grants are recognised when there is reasonable assurance that the group will comply with the conditions attached to them and the grants will be received. Export Incentives are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss as a part of other operating revenues.
