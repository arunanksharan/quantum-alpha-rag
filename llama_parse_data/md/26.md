# CEAT Annual Financial Report

CEAT, a tyre manufacturing company in India, has been impacted by various global economic factors in recent years. The GDP growth rates across different economies have fluctuated, with falling oil prices affecting nations heavily reliant on natural resources.

The crude oil prices have also seen significant changes, impacting both mature and developing economies worldwide.

In 2015, China experienced a slowdown in growth due to various factors, including weakening investments and industrial activity. However, the country is now focusing on domestic demand and structural reforms to drive future growth.

The global economy is expected to strengthen in 2016, with positive developments such as firming oil prices and improved financial markets. The IMF projects a gradual increase in global activity, with growth rates expected to rise in the coming years.

India, on the other hand, has emerged as a strong performer in the global economy, surpassing China in growth rate. The Indian economy grew at 7.6% in FY 2015-16, driven by manufacturing growth and favorable crude oil prices.

CEAT's consolidated sales have shown a consistent growth over the past five years, reflecting the company's resilience in a challenging economic environment.

Overall, despite global economic uncertainties, CEAT remains optimistic about its future prospects and is committed to driving sustainable growth in the tyre manufacturing industry.
