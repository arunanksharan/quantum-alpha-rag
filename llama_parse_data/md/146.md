## Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2016

2. The Competition Commission of India (CCI) had, while considering the representation made by All India Tyres Dealers Federation (AITDF) made a prima facie view that the major players of tyre industry (including the Company) had some understanding amongst themselves, especially in the replacement market, as they did not pass the benefit of corresponding reduction in prices of major raw material inputs for the period subsequent to the year 2011-12. According to CCI, this practice is in violation of the Competition Act, 2002 (“the Act”). Therefore, CCI had, vide its order passed on June 24, 2014 under Section 26(1) of the Act, directed the Office of the Director General (DG) to investigate the said alleged violation of the Act. DG submitted its Investigation Report to CCI in December 2015, based on which CCI passed an order on February 18, 2016 directing the said tyre manufacturers to file their suggestions / objections by May 5, 2016. The Company’s decision to change the price is purely a business decision which depends upon many factors like cost of production, brand value perception, and profit margin of each product, quality perception of each product in the market, demand and supply situation of each product category and market potential and market shares targets of various product categories etc. In view of the above the Company believes that it has a strong case.
