Financial Statements

a) Provision for warranty

A provision is recognized for expected warranty claims on products sold during the last three years, based on past experience of the level of returns and cost of claim. It is expected that a significant portion of these costs will be incurred in the next financial year and within three years from the reporting date. Assumptions used to calculate the provision for warranty were based on current sales levels and current information available about returns based on the three years warranty period for all products sold. The table below gives information about movement in warranty provision.
