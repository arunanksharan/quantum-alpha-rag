# CEAT Limited Annual Report 2015-16

Road safety is central to CEAT’s business philosophy and we strive to propagate the “Be Monsoon Smart” campaign through our various brand communications. Smart associations with the game of cricket is another key facet of our brand promotion efforts.

## CEAT SUV Campaign - 'Our Grip. Your Stories.'

Centred on highlighting our brand premiumness, this campaign is based on the concept of emotional inheritance. The campaign revolves around the story of the initiation of a child into the world by his father, who is anxious about the challenges that could confront his child. CEAT tyres, with their better grip and control, ensure that the child would have wonderful and larger than life stories and experiences to share about the time spent.

## Two-wheeler Tubeless Campaign

Led by the commitment to safety, our endeavour has been to promote tubeless tyres which are less likely to cause an accident due to sudden air leakage. With the largest range of tubeless tyres and an extensive distribution network, CEAT is running an extremely focussed campaign that brings out the human insight, coupled with the contextual relevance of the product.

CEAT’s alliance with Party Hard Drivers is to promote safe driving, reducing road mishaps and bringing down drunken-driving incidents.
