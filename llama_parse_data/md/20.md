# Snapshot FY 2015-16

An integrated community programme, Jeevan focusses on the improvement of all-round quality of life in the community. 5,536 people and 500 children were provided with supplementary food in order to reduce the prevalence of malnutrition in Halol under the Reduction of Malnutrition Programme.

Key initiatives under this project relate to providing clean drinking water, sanitation, and overall health & nutrition-based interventions. Sanitation and water initiatives were carried out in the target villages.

Going forward, installation of RO systems to ensure pure drinking water in schools, health care and awareness programmes for adolescent boys and girls, construction of sanitation units, and provision of nutritious supplements in schools are some of the important initiatives planned for FY 2016-17.
