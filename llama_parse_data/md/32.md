Volatility in Raw Material Prices: As a result of the sharp drop in natural rubber prices, and the resultant cut in production, the supply gap is likely to get wider in FY 2016-17. Lower inventory levels and the import restrictions on natural rubber are likely to pose challenges to domestic tyre manufacturers. Rupee volatility and heavy fluctuations in crude oil prices may exacerbate the situation.

## Industry Outlook

A broad-based economic recovery led by a massive push to infra spends, good monsoon, higher urban discretionary incomes, and a rural income turnaround may provide Indian tyre makers with exciting opportunities in OEM as well as replacement markets. The tyre demand is likely to be higher by 3.5-5.5% in FY 2016-17 and may improve further to 8%-10% in FY 2017-18. China may continue to pose a threat to Indian companies in the domestic TBR market and also in the export markets serviced.
