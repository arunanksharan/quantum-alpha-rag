## Corporate Overview

After declining for three consecutive years, production of commercial vehicles picked up in FY 2015-16. As the April 17 deadline for the implementation of Bharat Stage IV emission norms neared, replacement of the older fleet provided a fillip to the production of Medium & Heavy Commercial Vehicles (M&HCV). Optimistic scenario in the infrastructure segment and sizeable exports also resulted in better performance of the M&HCV category.

Oct 15: Capacity utilisation and Capex

The capital expenditure of the Indian tyre industry is in keeping with the trends in the auto industry.

Nov 15: As a result of benign demand, higher imports and falling exports, the capacity utilisation of the Indian tyre industry has fallen for the first time in the past three years. The capacity utilisation for the TBB segment was the lowest while that in two-wheeler was the highest.

Dec 15: In FY 2015-16, the companies operating in India invested `4,890 crore in capacity additions. In FY 2016-17, the companies are expected to allocate `9,140 crore for further enhancing capacities. The industry is witnessing a shift of focus from the commercial to the consumer segments, owing to the expectations of a favourable monsoon and a demand recovery led by high discretionary income and higher internal accruals.

### Regulatory Environment

The tyre industry has been impacted by the cut in natural rubber production by farmers in Kerala. Production was cut because of low rubber prices, and while the Indian Government took several measures to protect the farmers’ interests, natural rubber prices continued falling, and output was curbed.

Some of the key measures taken by the Central & State Governments impacting raw material prices were:

- The Kerala Government announced a scheme in July 2015 of assured price of `150 per kg for rubber farmers, who are facing a crisis due to the sharp fall in natural rubber prices. The price support is available to

### Financial Statements

A recent survey reveals that China’s manufacturing sector expanded for the second month in a row in April but only marginally, raising doubts about the sustainability of this pick-up.

In the coming months, domestic natural rubber prices are expected to remain range-bound, driven by international price movements. Prices of crude derivatives, such as carbon black, rubber chemicals and synthetic rubber, are expected to largely move in line with the crude oil prices.
