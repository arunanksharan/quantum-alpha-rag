Advances receivable in cash or kind or for value to be received majorly include advances to material vendors, export benefits receivable, prepaid expenses, rent deposits, etc. The increase is majorly on account of the increase in the export benefit receivable as of March 31, 2016.

Balance with statutory/government authorities mostly include octroi refunds, cenvat receivable, service tax receivable, advance customs duty, etc. The increase is mainly on account of cenvat receivable on the capex incurred for Halol Phase II project as well as Nagpur project. As per the Cenvat Credit Rules 2004, the cenvat credit on capital goods is restricted to 50% in the first year.

Prepaid expenses are unamortized expenses towards various license fees, finance charges, insurance charges, and other expenses in the normal course of business. The increase is on account of prepaid insurance expenses since the renewal of insurance policies was aligned at the year-end to have uniformity in the period of all the insurance policies.

Revaluation of hedging instrument signifies mark-to-market short-term valuation of the hedging instruments as of March 31, 2016. The short-term buyerâ€™s credit was nil as of March 31, 2016, and the ECB loan from ICICI Bank, among the foreign currency loan, was prepaid during the current year. Hence there was a corresponding reduction in revaluation gain on the hedging instruments.
