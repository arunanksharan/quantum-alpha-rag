The Company operates in India through a robust distribution network of 4300+ dealers, 33 regional offices, 400+ CEAT franchisees and 250+ distributors.\n\nThe Company\u2019s consolidated sales have grown over the past five years at a CAGR of 10%. The Company has achieved a remarkable turnaround in profitability over the past three years mainly by improving its product mix, lower finance costs and moderate raw material costs. With increasing capacities, robust focus on R&D, new product launches, fast-paced brand investments, growing channel strengths and a stronger balance sheet, the Company is well positioned for a sustained growth trajectory.\n\nAs far as the market segmentation is concerned, out of the Company\u2019s total Revenue pie, the replacement market, OEM and exports account for 64%, 23% and 13%, respectively.\n\n## Changing Product Mix\n\nThe CEAT brand has always been relevant with a high top of-the-mind recall. The growth strategy for the Company is that we set up at Halol in 2011. The distribution network was pivoted around having great products and enhancing the customer experience during and after the purchase. The Company is present in all categories of tyres, from commercial vehicles to cars to two wheelers. Within these, the passenger segment (comprising passenger cars, utility vehicles and two wheeler tyres) has emerged as a high growth segment. This has been on account of the GDP growth, growing disposable income, poor public transportation and lower passenger vehicle penetration in India. We have therefore decided to enhance our focus towards the passenger segment.\n\nWith focus on these categories and safety as the core premise, we continuously churned out technologically superior products, thanks to the contemporary and state-of-the-art R&D Centre.\n\n### Changing Product Mix (%)\n\nThe revenues from the segment in the total pie have gone up from 15% in FY 2010-11 to 39% in FY 2015-16. In terms of revenues, the two wheeler segments witnessed phenomenal CAGRs of 32%, respectively, between FY 2010-11 and FY 2015-16 whereas, for passenger cars and utility vehicles put together, grew at a CAGR of 34% for the corresponding period.\n\nThe Company\u2019s endeavour is to have a further increase the share of the Passenger Segment. In the Commercial Segment, the focus will continue to be on improving productivity and continuing to grow and develop radial capability. In a step towards further diversification, the Company has initiated the construction of a greenfield manufacturing facility, through its 100% subsidiary, CEAT Specialty Tyres Limited (CSTL), in Ambernath, Maharashtra. CSTL will concentrate on Off Highway Tyres primarily with the focus on exports.\n\nThe Company believes it can sustain the benefits of its improved product mix through more intensive efforts put into building brand loyalty, adding more OEM relationships, expanding the distribution network, and maintaining the tempo in new product launches.

The contribution for gratuity has an inverse relation with the movement in the applicable discounting rate as a lower interest rate requires a higher contribution to provide for comparable future liability.\n\n### Other Expenses Analysis\n\nOther expenses primarily include the following expenses:\n\n|Particulars|FY 2015-16|FY 2014-15|Change|Change %|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Conversion charges|36,946.74|29,473.39|7,473.35|25.36|\n|Stores and spares|4,503.59|4,470.28|33.31|0.75|\n|Power & fuel|16,430.59|17,339.91|(909.32)|(5.24)|\n|Freight & delivery charges|26,092.54|23,845.84|2,246.70|9.42|\n|Repairs|5,916.00|6,005.00|(89.00)|(1.48)|\n|Traveling & conveyance|3,338.35|2,789.05|549.30|19.69|\n|Advertisement and sales promotion|11,851.48|10,421.35|1,430.13|13.72|\n|Professional & consultancy charges|2,786.92|1,646.64|1,140.28|69.25|\n|Rebates & discounts|5,340.51|4,714.27|626.24|13.28|\n|Loss on asset sold/discarded|1,061.69|71.34|990.35|1388.21|\n|Bank charges|664.02|1,045.32|(381.30)|(36.48)|",

Sales of two/ three wheeler has grown by\n19.77% in revenue and from 23.32% to 27.76% in a mix of total revenue. Consequently conversion charges have increased\nby 25.36 % vs previous year.\n\n\n\nPower and fuel charges reduction is an outcome of reduction in the furnace oil prices by nearly 50% and Gas prices by nearly\n25%. Freight and delivery charges have increased on account of changes in the sales mix and volumes. Over the last few years,\nthere is a strategic focus to increase the product mix in passenger segment like two/ three wheeler, PCR & UVR. These categories\nrequires higher storage space and are lower in density, thus requiring excess travel resulting in higher freight charges which is\na structural shift in the freight charges. There was also slight change in the diesel prices during the year which impacted the\nfreight charges to some extent. The Company has been consciously focusing on enhancing the brand equity through effective\nmarketing. This is witnessed by the innovative ad campaigns, continued association with IPL, association with cricketers for\npromoting CEAT logo on to their bats, etc. which resulted in the increased advertisement & marketing expenditure. Professional\n& consultancy charges showed a steep growth on account of services availed in the strategic space.\n\n\n\nRebates and discounts are mainly on account of incentives given to customers for prompt payments which has shown an\nupward movement. Loss on sale /discard of assets has displayed a surge over the previous year. This is mainly because of\nthe asset discarded in the process of plant set up for Halol Phase II. Further, the company has the policy to procure and keep\nin custody insurance spares for major machineries. As these spares can be only used in connection with a particular plant &\nmachinery and its use is expected to be irregular, these spares are eligible for capitalization on procurement. On actual usage\nof these spares, the value of worn out spares are charged to P&L. The bank charges has shown a drastic decline on account of\nreduced borrowings in the current year vis-\u00e0-vis previous year.\n\n\n\nEBITDA (including other income and before exceptional items) analysis\nThe EBITDA has gone up by 21.22% for the year, while EBITDA margin as a percentage of total revenue increased to 14.84%\nin the current year as compared to 12.17% for previous year. The increase in EBITDA is largely on account of lower material\ncost, improved product mix (higher mix of passenger segment viz. two / three wheeler, passenger car radial, etc) to 39.25% of\ntotal revenue as against 33.70% in the previous year and lower raw material cost.\n\n\n\nFinance cost analysis (Note 24, Page 192)                                                                                           (` in Lacs)\n  Particulars                                            FY 2015-16                   FY 2014-15                          Change    Change %\n  Interest                                                  8,334.69                    10,895.07                    (2,560.38)        (23.50)\n  Other borrowing cost                                         739.21                     2,291.42                   (1,552.21)        (67.74)\n  Total                                                     9,073.90                    13,186.49                    (4,112.59)        (31.19)\n\n\n\nInterest comprises interest on term loans and various forms of working capital loans, primarily dealer deposits, public deposit,\nbuyers\u2019 credit, bill discounting, commercial papers etc. Other borrowing costs mostly comprise currency hedging costof buyers\u2019\ncredit and processing fees.\n\n\n\nDuring the year, the average borrowings reduced on account of better profitability and effective use of working capital.

Professional & consultancy charges showed a steep growth on account of services availed in the strategic space.\n\nRebates and discounts are mainly on account of incentives given to customers for prompt payments which has shown an upward movement. Loss on sale /discard of assets has displayed a surge over the previous year. This is mainly because of the asset discarded in the process of plant set up for Halol Phase II. Further, the company has the policy to procure and keep in custody insurance spares for major machineries. As these spares can be only used in connection with a particular plant & machinery and its use is expected to be irregular, these spares are eligible for capitalization on procurement. On actual usage of these spares, the value of worn out spares are charged to P&L. The bank charges has shown a drastic decline on account of reduced borrowings in the current year vis-\u00e0-vis previous year."

An asset\u2019s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset\u2019s or cash-generating unit\u2019s (CGU) net selling price and its value in use. The recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. If such recoverable amount of the asset or the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs is less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable amount. The reduction is treated as an impairment loss and is recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss. After impairment, depreciation is provided on the revised carrying amount of the asset over its remaining useful life.\n\nThe Company bases its impairment calculations of detailed budgets and forecast calculations which are prepared separately for each of the Company\u2019s cash-generating units to which the individual assets are allocated. These budgets and forecast calculations are generally covering a period of 5 years.

The Competition Commission of India (CCI) had, while considering the representation made by All India Tyres                                  Corporate Overview\n                    Dealers Federation (AITDF) made a prima facie view that the major players of tyre industry (including the\n                    Company) had some understanding amongst themselves, especially in the replacement market, as they did not\n                    pass the benefit of corresponding reduction in prices of major raw material inputs for the period subsequent\n                    to the year 2011-12. According to CCI, this practice is in violation of the Competition Act, 2002 (\u201cthe Act\u201d).\n                    Therefore, CCI had, vide its order passed on June 24, 2014 under Section 26(1) of the Act, directed the Office\n                    of the Director General (DG) to investigate the said alleged violation of the Act. DG submitted its Investigation\n                    Report to CCI in December 2015, based on which CCI passed an order on February 18, 2016 directing the said\n                    tyre manufacturers to file their suggestions / objections by May 5, 2016. The Company\u2019s decision to change\n                    the price is purely a business decision which depends upon many factors like cost of production, brand value\n                    perception, and profit margin of each product, quality perception of each product in the market, demand and\n                    supply situation of each product category and market potential and market shares targets of various product\n                    categories etc. In view of the above the Company believes that it has a strong case.\n\n\n\n29.

Corporate Information\n\nCEAT Limited is a public Company domiciled in India and incorporated under the provisions of the Companies Act, 1956. The Company\u2019s principal business is manufacturing of automotive tyres, tubes and flaps. The Company started operations in 1958 as CEAT Tyres of India Limited and was renamed as CEAT Limited in 1990. The Company caters to both domestic and international markets.\n\n2. Basis of Consolidation and Significant Accounting Policies\n\nA) Basis of Accounting and preparation of financial statements\n\nThe Consolidated financial statements have been prepared and presented under the historical cost convention and on the accrual basis of accounting, unless stated otherwise and comply with the mandatory Accounting Standards (\u2018AS\u2019) notified under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read together with paragraph 7 of the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014 and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. The financial statements have been prepared on an accrual basis and under the historical cost convention except for land, building and plant and equipments acquired before 2007 which are carried at revalued amounts and derivative financial instruments which have been measured at fair value.\n\nThe accounting policies adopted in the preparation of financial statements are consistent with those of the previous year, except for the change in accounting policy explained below.\n\nComponent Accounting\n\nThe group has adopted component accounting as required under schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 from April 1, 2015. The group was previously not identifying components of fixed assets separately for depreciation purpose; rather a single useful life / depreciation rate was used to depreciate each item of fixed asset.\n\nDue to application of schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013, the group has changed the manner of depreciation for its fixed assets. Now, the group identifies and determines cost of each component / part of the asset separately, if the component / part has a cost which is significant to the total cost to the asset and having useful life that is materially different from that of the remaining assets. These components are depreciated over their useful lives; the remaining asset is depreciated over the life of the principal asset. The group has used the transitional provision of schedule II to adjust the impact of component accounting arising on its first application.\n\nIf a component has zero remaining useful life on the date of component accounting becoming effecting i.e. April 1, 2015, its carrying amount after retaining any residual value is charged to the general reserve. The carrying amount of other components i.e. components whose remaining useful life is not nil as on April 1, 2015, is depreciated over their remaining useful lives.\n\nHad the Company continued to use the earlier policy of depreciating fixed assets, its financial statements for the period would have been impacted as below:\n\n- Depreciation for the current period would have been lower by `523.16 Lacs. Profit for the current period would have been higher by `377.48 Lacs (net of tax impact of `145.68 Lacs). Fixed assets would correspondingly have been higher by `523.16 Lacs.\n- On the date of component accounting becoming applicable, i.e. April 1, 2015, the amount of `586.72 Lacs (net of deferred tax `274.52 Lacs) has been directly adjusted against retained earnings on account of depreciable value as on April 1, 2015 for the components having zero remaining useful life.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared using uniform accounting policy for all like transaction and event under similar circumstances. The consolidated financial statements relate to CEAT Limited (the Company) and its subsidiary companies (referred to as \u201cthe Group\u201d).\n\nii) Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with Indian GAAP requires the management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent liabilities, at the end of the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on the management\u2019s best knowledge of current events and actions, uncertainty about these assumption and estimates could result in the outcomes requiring a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities in future periods.\n\niii) Principles of consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the following basis:",

The carrying amount of other components i.e. components whose remaining useful life is not nil as on April 1, 2015, is depreciated over their remaining useful lives.\n\nHad the Company continued to use the earlier policy of depreciating fixed assets, its financial statements for the period would have been impacted as below:\n\n- Depreciation for the current period would have been lower by `523.16 Lacs.

Fixed assets would correspondingly have been higher by `523.16 Lacs.\n- On the date of component accounting becoming applicable, i.e. April 1, 2015, the amount of `586.72 Lacs (net of deferred tax `274.52 Lacs) has been directly adjusted against retained earnings on account of depreciable value as on April 1, 2015 for the components having zero remaining useful life.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared using uniform accounting policy for all like transaction and event under similar circumstances.

                        "md": "1. Corporate Information\n\nCEAT Limited is a public Company domiciled in India and incorporated under the provisions of the Companies Act, 1956. The Company\u2019s principal business is manufacturing of automotive tyres, tubes and flaps. The Company started operations in 1958 as CEAT Tyres of India Limited and was renamed as CEAT Limited in 1990. The Company caters to both domestic and international markets.\n\n2. Basis of Consolidation and Significant Accounting Policies\n\nA) Basis of Accounting and preparation of financial statements\n\nThe Consolidated financial statements have been prepared and presented under the historical cost convention and on the accrual basis of accounting, unless stated otherwise and comply with the mandatory Accounting Standards (\u2018AS\u2019) notified under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read together with paragraph 7 of the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014 and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. The financial statements have been prepared on an accrual basis and under the historical cost convention except for land, building and plant and equipments acquired before 2007 which are carried at revalued amounts and derivative financial instruments which have been measured at fair value.\n\nThe accounting policies adopted in the preparation of financial statements are consistent with those of the previous year, except for the change in accounting policy explained below.\n\nComponent Accounting\n\nThe group has adopted component accounting as required under schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 from April 1, 2015. The group was previously not identifying components of fixed assets separately for depreciation purpose; rather a single useful life / depreciation rate was used to depreciate each item of fixed asset.\n\nDue to application of schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013, the group has changed the manner of depreciation for its fixed assets. Now, the group identifies and determines cost of each component / part of the asset separately, if the component / part has a cost which is significant to the total cost to the asset and having useful life that is materially different from that of the remaining assets. These components are depreciated over their useful lives; the remaining asset is depreciated over the life of the principal asset. The group has used the transitional provision of schedule II to adjust the impact of component accounting arising on its first application.\n\nIf a component has zero remaining useful life on the date of component accounting becoming effecting i.e. April 1, 2015, its carrying amount after retaining any residual value is charged to the general reserve. The carrying amount of other components i.e. components whose remaining useful life is not nil as on April 1, 2015, is depreciated over their remaining useful lives.\n\nHad the Company continued to use the earlier policy of depreciating fixed assets, its financial statements for the period would have been impacted as below:\n\n- Depreciation for the current period would have been lower by `523.16 Lacs. Profit for the current period would have been higher by `377.48 Lacs (net of tax impact of `145.68 Lacs). Fixed assets would correspondingly have been higher by `523.16 Lacs.\n- On the date of component accounting becoming applicable, i.e. April 1, 2015, the amount of `586.72 Lacs (net of deferred tax `274.52 Lacs) has been directly adjusted against retained earnings on account of depreciable value as on April 1, 2015 for the components having zero remaining useful life.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared using uniform accounting policy for all like transaction and event under similar circumstances.

Their Statement of Profit and Loss are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the dates of transactions or weighted average weekly rates, where such rates approximate the exchange rate at the date of transaction. The exchange differences arising on translation are accumulated in the foreign currency translation reserve. On disposal of a non-integral foreign operation, the accumulated foreign currency translation reserve relating to that foreign operation is recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\n\nWhen there is a change in the classification of a foreign operation, the translation procedures applicable to the revised classification are applied from the date of the change in the classification.\n\nL) Leases\n\nWhere the Company is lessee Finance leases, which effectively transfer to the Company substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are capitalized at the inception of the lease term at the lower of the fair value of the leased property and present value of minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are recognized as finance costs in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Lease management fees, legal charges and other initial direct costs of lease are capitalized.\n\nA leased asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the asset. However, if there is no reasonable certainty that the Company will obtain the ownership by the end of the lease term, the capitalized asset is depreciated on a basis over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term whichever is earlier.\n\nM) Research and Development\n\nResearch costs are expensed as incurred.

Pursuant to the Companies Act, 2013 (\u201cthe Act\u201d), the management, based on internal technical evaluation has\n       assessed the major components and useful life of fixed assets.

Consequently, the General Reserve has been\n       reduced by ` 586.72 Lacs (net of deferred tax ` 274.52 Lacs).\n\n\n\n6.

With\n       the acquisition of the brand which is renowned worldwide, new and hitherto unexplored markets are accessible to\n       the Company. The Company will be in a position to fully exploit the export market resulting in increased volume and\n       price realization.

In accordance with the Act, the carrying value of the component of fixed assets as at April 1, 2015 is depreciated over the balance residual life of the fixed assets and where the balance residual life is nil as at that date, the carrying value of the component of fixed assets, after retaining the residual value, has been adjusted to the General Reserve. Consequently, the General Reserve has been reduced by ` 586.72 Lacs (net of deferred tax ` 274.52 Lacs).\n\n6.

With the acquisition of the brand which is renowned worldwide, new and hitherto unexplored markets are accessible to the Company. The Company will be in a position to fully exploit the export market resulting in increased volume and price realization. Therefore, the management believes that the Brand will yield significant benefits for a period of at least twenty years.\n\n8.

As a part of ongoing expansion project at Halol, during the year the Company has capitalized and commissioned assets of ` 44,768.09 Lacs.
