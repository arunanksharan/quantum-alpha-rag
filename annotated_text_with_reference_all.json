The tyres are built with unique \npuncture pads, to provide puncture protection. The \n600-16 Aayushmaan plus is the first tractor front tyre in the industry to have these unique puncture pads. In \naddition, the Aayushmaan plus rear tyres are designed \nwith sturdy shoulder design and deep lugs, resulting in better load carrying capability and longer life, respectively. \nAayushmaan plus front tyres have higher non-skid depth \n(NSD), leading to longer tyre life. \n  CEAT has rolled out customised tyres for electric two-wheelers. A new range of Zoom XL tyres, which were \nmade exclusively for electric motorcycles were launched. \nThe first variant of the tyre was rolled out for Pune-based start-up Tork Motorcycles\u2019 first electric motorcycle T6X. \nOEMs\n  CEAT was the first source for new vehicles like Hero Achiever, Bajaj V12, Honda Navi and Mahindra Bolero Power+. \nBranding Initiatives\u2018Our Grip, Your Stories\u2019\nCEAT launched the brand campaign of \u2018Our Grip, Your Story\u2019 for SUV tyres. The campaign aimed to establish the superior grip \nand control of CEAT tyres in demanding off-road terrains, thus \nmaking CEAT as a preferred choice for SUV tyres. \n\u2018Our Grip, Your Stories\u2019 targeted the young and bold breed \nof premium SUV owners who seek the thrill of exploring demanding on- and off-road terrains. The campaign focused on the safety and grip of tyres offered by CEAT and showed how an excellent tyre enabled drivers to get truly unbelievable \nexperiences, and in turn, give wings to a child\u2019r imagination. \n\u2018Drive Safe Dad campaign\u2019\nCEAT\u2019s Bobblehead campaign focused on discouraging dads \nfrom over-speeding their vehicles which is one of the major causes for road accidents. Keeping in mind CEAT\u2019purpose \nof \u2018Making Mobility Safer and Smarter. Every day\u2019, this concept \noriginated from the fact that parents tend to take road safety more seriously, when they hear it directly from their kids. \nThe idea was based on a simple premise, that drivers are often \nreluctant to fit speed sensors in their car. That\u2019why CEAT chose kids to persuade their fathers. Dads, on the other hand, \nloved this gesture as it subtly reminded them to drive within speed limits and served as a conscience meter. \nThe second part of this campaign originated from an innovative \nidea that blends emotions and technology in one package. In \nthis initiative, the dads received a personalised bobble head \nwhich was attached to the odometer of the vehicle. On over \nIndia\u2019s first premium electric bike Tork T6X was launched on CEAT tyres.\n\"\"\",\n  \"annotations\": [\n    {\n      \"start\": 0,\n      \"end\": 44,\n      \"text\": \"\",\n      \"tags\": [\"Company\", \"Introduction\"]\n    },\n    {\n      \"start\": 45,\n      \"end\": 52,\n      \"text\": \"launched \u2018Aayushmaan Plus\u2019 range of tractor\",\n      \"tags\": [\"New Product Launch\", \"Tractor Tyres\"]\n    },\n    {\n      \"start\": 53,\n      \"end\": 61,\n      \"text\": \"unique puncture pads, to provide puncture protection.\",\n      \"tags\": [\"Product Feature\", \"Puncture Protection\"]\n    },\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: The `annotations` field contains an array of objects, each representing a specific annotation with its corresponding start and end indices, text, and tags.",

With the acquisition of the brand which is renowned worldwide, new and hitherto unexplored markets will be accessible to the Group. The Group will be in a position to fully exploit the export market resulting in increased volume and better price realization.

The Group has based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the financial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances arising that are beyond the control of the Group. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.\n\na) Taxes Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax credits at Nashik manufacturing facility. In determining the fair value of the provision, assumptions and estimates are made in relation to discount rates, the expected cost to dismantle and remove the plant from the site and the expected timing of those costs. The carrying amount of the provision as at March 31, 2017 was \u20b9 54.69 lacs (March 31, 2016: \u20b9 49.06 lacs, April 1, 2015: \u20b9 44.00 lacs). The Group estimates that the costs would be realised in year 2066 at the expiration of the lease.\",\n  \"section\": [\"Financial Statements\", \"Notes to Financial Statements\"],\n  \"title\": \"Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions\",\n  \"content_summary\": \"Overview of significant accounting judgements, estimates, and assumptions made by CEAT Limited in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2017.\",\n  \"details\": [\n    {\"tag\": [\"Taxes\", \"Deferred tax assets\"], \"description\": \"Unused tax credits at Nashik manufacturing facility\"},\n    {\"tag\": [\"Discount rates\", \"Expected cost to dismantle and remove plant\"], \"description\": \"Assumptions made in determining fair value of provision\"}\n  ],\n  \"tags\": [\"CEAT Limited\", \"financial statements\", \"accounting judgements\", \"estimates and assumptions\"]\n}\n```\n\nNote: The JSON output is based on the provided text, section title, content summary, and details.

In 2015, China recorded a rise of 6% in Passenger Vehicle (PV) sales, while sales of Commercial Vehicles (CV) dropped 9%. China accounts for one-third of the global tyre industry and developments there have huge global implications. In FY 2015-16, the Chinese tyre market faced tough challenges.\n\n**Market Size:** A combination of overcapacities, anti-dumping probes in major consumer markets such as the U.S., and weaker domestic demand has made Chinese tyre manufacturers sell in a distressed manner. This desperation is disrupting the other markets. China has been the biggest threat to Indian tyre manufacturers, especially in the TBR (Truck-Bus Radial) segment.\n\n**Sales Trends:** In 2015, there was a 6% rise in Passenger Vehicle sales, while Commercial Vehicle sales dropped by 9%.\n\n**Challenges:** The Chinese tyre market faced significant challenges in FY 2015-16, including overcapacities, anti-dumping probes by the U.S., and weaker domestic demand.\n\n**Impact:** These challenges have led Chinese manufacturers to sell tyres in a distressed manner, disrupting other markets, particularly the Indian TBR (Truck-Bus Radial) market. China has been able to supply TBR almost at the cost of TBB (Truck-Bus Bias) tyres, earning it a healthy market share in India\u2019s TBR replacement market.\n\n**Competitive Dynamics:** Without anti-dumping duties being in place, China has been able to gain a substantial market share in India\u2019s TBR replacement market by pricing TBR tyres competitively against TBB (Truck-Bus Bias) tyres.\n\nTags: [\"China tyre market\", \"global impact\", \"anti-dumping\", \"market disruption\", \"Indian tyre market competition\"]\n\nNote that the tags are used to provide additional context and relevance for Retrieval Augmented Generation.",

The Company designates these forward contracts and interest rate swaps in a hedging relationship by applying the hedge accounting principles of AS-30 \u201cFinancial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement\u201d. \nFor the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as:\n1. Fair value hedges when hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment.\n2. Cash flow hedges when hedging the exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognized asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction or the foreign currency risk in an unrecognized firm commitment.\nAt the inception of a hedge relationship, the Company formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which the Company wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the Company will assess the effectiveness of changes in the hedging instrument\u2019s fair value in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item\u2019s fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. Such hedges are expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows and are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they actually have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which they were designated.\nHedges that meet the strict criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for as described below:\nFair value hedges\nThe change in the fair value of a hedging derivative is recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss. The change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk hedged is recorded as part of the carrying value of the hedged item and is also recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\nCash flow hedges\nThe gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

It has a robust stakeholder engagement process to assess and cater to their specific needs.\nThe Company identified its key \nstakeholders by developing an initial list of interested parties, considering historical concerns and relationships, and having discussions, where required. This identification was followed by the development of an engagement plan, proportionate to the nature and scale of each stakeholder group. During this engagement, the Company disclosed information to each of the stakeholder groups in order to maximise participation. CEAT then undertook meaningful consultations with each stakeholder group by offering them platforms to freely express their views and opinions, which were addressed appropriately.As a result, the Company takes an inclusive approach towards stakeholders by engaging with them through meaningful dialogue and then identifying the topics that are of high priority. The resultant outcome is used to develop Key Performance Indicators  (KPIs), align them with the Company\u2019s business model, and communicate their performance across each of the capitals.CEAT LIMITED   | ANNUAL REPORT 2019-20\n25 24CORPORATE OVERVIEW VALUE CREATION STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\"\"\",\n    \"annotations\": [\n        {\"tag\": [\"Stakeholder Engagement\", \"Materiality Analysis\"], \"summary\": \"CEAT recognises the importance of engaging with stakeholders on a regular basis, and the need to understand their concerns, for long-term business sustainability.\"},\n        {\"tag\": [\"Investors\", \"Shareholders\"], \"summary\": \"Provide financial capital\"},\n        {\"tag\": [\"Customers\", \"Tyre Dealerships\"], \"summary\": \"Support CEAT in reaching end-users\"},\n        {\"tag\": [\"Employees\"], \"summary\": \"Serve as drivers for all business activities\"},\n        {\"tag\": [\"Collaborators\", \"Business Partners\"], \"summary\": \"Enable strategic alliances\"},\n        {\"tag\": [\"Industry Associations\"], \"summary\": \"Provide insight into industry trends\"},\n        {\"tag\": [\"Suppliers\"], \"summary\": \"Provide materials/services for business operations\"},\n        {\"tag\": [\"Communities\", \"NGOs\"], \"summary\": \"Help in creating shared value\"}\n    ],\n    \"labels\": [\n        {\"label\": \"Stakeholder Engagement\", \"category\": \"Business\"},\n        {\"label\": \"Materiality Analysis\", \"category\": \"Financial\"},\n        {\"label\": \"Investors\", \"category\": \"Finance\"},\n        {\"label\": \"Shareholders\", \"category\": \"Finance\"},\n        {\"label\": \"Customers\", \"category\": \"Market\"},\n        {\"label\": \"Tyre Dealerships\", \"category\": \"Market\"},\n        {\"label\": \"Employees\", \"category\": \"Human Resources\"},\n        {\"label\": \"Collaborators\", \"category\": \"Business\"},\n        {\"label\": \"Business Partners\", \"category\": \"Business\"},\n        {\"label\": \"Industry Associations\", \"category\": \"Industry\"},\n        {\"label\": \"Suppliers\", \"category\": \"Operations\"},\n        {\"label\": \"Communities\", \"category\": \"Society\"},\n        {\"label\": \"NGOs\", \"category\": \"Society\"}\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: The annotations and labels are based on the provided text, but may not be exhaustive or accurate.",

This everlasting grip action is effective even up to 80% tyre wear, thus providing complete confidence and safety to the rider throughout the lifetime of the tyre.\nThese tyres are designed to provide a mix of comfort and safety at high speed driving. The tyres have wide longitudinal grooves intended for aquaplaning resistance, while the new generation compound is intended to provide superior grip. Their optimised tread pattern helps in lowering the noise, thereby giving customers a peaceful and comfortable drive.\nThese innovative tyres come with puncture resistant technology to ensure that customers enjoy a hassle-free and safe ride without the fear of punctures, which are the most common cause of two-wheeler accidents in India.Nagpur plant was awarded with the coveted \u2018Sword of Honour\u2019 by British Safety Council for demonstrating highest standard of health, safety and environmental management.Bhandup plant was successfully certified with ISO 45001:2018, Standard for Occupational Health & Safety Management System, first in Indian tyre industry, achieving it in a short span of 6 months from the release of the standard.

The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values. Judgements include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility.

For eign currency risk\nFor eign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of changes in \nforeign exchange rates. The Group\u2019 s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to the Group\u2019 s \noperating activities (when revenue or expense is denominated in a foreign currency) and the Group\u2019 s net investments in foreign \nsubsidiaries.\nThe Gr oup manages its foreign currency risk by hedging transactions that are expected to occur within a maximum 6 month \nperiod for the foreign currency denominated trade payables and trade receivables. The foreign currency risk on the foreign currency loans are mitigated by entering into Cross Currency Swaps. When a derivative is entered into for the purpose of being a hedge, the Group negotiates the terms of those derivatives to match the terms of the hedged exposure.
