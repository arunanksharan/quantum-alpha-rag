Launched in Italy in January 2016, this tyre range currently encompasses two new patterns – CEAT EcoDrive & CEAT SecuraDrive. While the EcoDrive is ideal for low rolling resistance tyres needed for city driving, SecuraDrive has been developed for high wet grip tyres for safer highway driving. The range is set to be expanded with more patterns during FY 2016-17.

## Be Fuelsmart

CEAT’s first low rolling resistance pattern for hatch-backs and entry-level sedans which saves up to 7% of fuel as compared to normal tyres.

Road safety is central to CEAT’s business philosophy and we strive to propagate the “Be Monsoon Smart” campaign through our various brand communications. Smart associations with the game of cricket is another key facet of our brand promotion efforts.

## CEAT SUV Campaign - 'Our Grip. Your Stories.'

Centred on highlighting our brand premiumness, this campaign is based on the concept of emotional inheritance. The campaign revolves around the story of the initiation of a child into the world by his father, who is anxious about the challenges that could confront his child. CEAT tyres, with their better grip and control, ensure that the child would have wonderful and larger than life stories and experiences to share about the time spent.

## Two-wheeler Tubeless Campaign

Led by the commitment to safety, our endeavour has been to promote tubeless tyres which are less likely to cause an accident due to sudden air leakage. With the largest range of tubeless tyres and an extensive distribution network, CEAT is running an extremely focussed campaign that brings out the human insight, coupled with the contextual relevance of the product.

CEAT’s alliance with Party Hard Drivers is to promote safe driving, reducing road mishaps and bringing down drunken-driving incidents.

Enabling a Safe & Smart Workplace

Making our workplaces safe and smart is a key priority of the organisation. This is ensured through extensive processes and systems which are validated by the certifications awarded by reputed safety accreditation agencies. Digitisation of the workplace systems and interactions with various stakeholders is another aspect which highlights our smart business approach and leads to improved efficiencies at work.

Endorsing our commitment towards occupational safety, our Halol plant has been awarded a five-star rating by the prestigious British Safety Council (BSC). It is the highest grading in Occupational Health & Safety (OH&S) Management System Audits and CEAT Halol is the first tyre manufacturing plant in India to receive this accreditation.

## Paperless Board Meetings

The adoption of a new digital application has enabled the Company to conduct 'Paperless Board Meetings', thereby improving governance while simplifying the process of conducting such meetings. This smart way involves conducting the meetings digitally and efficaciously, with the Board of Directors being able to access information, directly on their digital devices.

## Mobile App for Customers - Dealer Portal

The CEAT Mobile app was launched to provide customers all relevant information on our product range, to give them tyre service reminders and locate CEAT authorised dealers, so as to make it convenient for them to choose, maintain and replace their tyres. This app also provides value-added information pertaining to the nearest utility services like ATMs, petrol pumps etc.

Corporate Overview

For us, at CEAT, the concept of smart and safe mobility extends beyond the road, to touch the lives of the people in the communities around which we operate, as also the society at large. Our CSR touch-points encompass a range of activities, extending from education to health care, water and sanitation. During the year under review, we scaled up our CSR interventions to cross new milestones of success.

Netranjali Project

Focused on preventive eye care, our Netranjali project reached out to an increased number of school children, truckers, and elderly patients in slum communities during the year. For effective implementation of the program, we partnered with two renowned NGOs, SHARP & Sightsavers. Through the year, we held a series of school and community camps to deliver free eye care, including vision testing, early detection of eye problems, first-line management of eye emergencies, and distribution of free spectacles, through networking with various stakeholders. Our eye care initiatives for truck drivers spanned a range of interventions, including screening for eye defects and refractive errors, dispensation of free spectacles, referrals, and periodic follow-ups. An impact study, conducted during the year, also found that the Netranjali Truckers Programme had a very positive impact on road safety and truckers’ safety.

Going forward, the project will be scaled up further to increase the number of locations, besides adding to the number of vision centers, beneficiaries, and reach.

Snapshot FY 2015-16

These women were trained in driving schools to render them employable as taxi and school van drivers, as well as entrepreneurs. The project implementation was further strengthened through collaborations with Motor Education and Training Association (META), iCare Life, and Western India Automobile Association (WIAA).

Going forward, our aim is to augment our existing programs and provide training to women in auto-rickshaw driving, heavy motor vehicle driving, and 8-seater auto-rickshaw driving. We also plan to expand the project into new cities in the eastern parts of India.

Snapshot FY 2015-16

## Management Discussion and Analysis

Company Overview: As an organisation committed to long-term value delivery to all its stakeholders, CEAT is continuously engaged in investing in high-growth areas yielding better returns. The passenger segment (comprising passenger cars, utility vehicles and two-wheeler tyres) has emerged as a high growth segment. The key factors behind this growth are GDP growth, growing disposable income, poor public transportation, and lower passenger vehicle penetration in India.

Seeing the huge potential for growth in the passenger segment, the Company repositioned itself to focus more concertedly and consistently in this area about five years ago. This was led by steady investments in brand building, new and innovative product developments, robust Research & Development (R&D) initiatives, and extensive expansion of the distribution network.

Further scaling up its focus on the passenger segment, the Company embarked on large investments in capacity augmentation. A major initiative in this regard included the creation of additional capacity of 120 MT/day primarily for Passenger Vehicle Radial Tyres as Halol Phase II, besides another 120 MT/day capacity addition in a Greenfield plant in Nagpur for 2/3 wheeler tyres.

These initiatives have resulted in the contribution of the passenger segment to the overall revenue pie at CEAT, significantly going up from 15% in FY 2010-11 to 39% in FY 2015-16, with a CAGR of 33%. With increased earnings reported from these segments, CEAT posted a higher growth than the industry over the last 5 years.

### Global Economy

Amid persistent sluggishness in the global economy, the overall sentiment remained weak through the year. While advanced economies reported modest and uneven recovery, growth in the emerging markets and developing economies decelerated sharply. Slowly improving growth prospects and a favorable policy environment helped advanced economies put up a better show than emerging economies.

The global economy continued to push against continuing macro headwinds during the year 2016. Amidst geo-political turbulence in the Middle East and major macroeconomic realignments across large emerging economies, the world output for the year 2015 increased by 3.1%, marginally lower than the 3.4% growth in 2014, according to the World Economic Outlook of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) (April 2016).

In the U.S., the GDP grew at 2.4% in 2015, similar to 2014. However, there are distinct positive signs in the largest economy in the form of improving labor market indicators.

# CEAT Annual Financial Report

# CEAT Annual Financial Report

CEAT, a tyre manufacturing company in India, has been impacted by various global economic factors in recent years. The GDP growth rates across different economies have fluctuated, with falling oil prices affecting nations heavily reliant on natural resources.

The crude oil prices have also seen significant changes, impacting both mature and developing economies worldwide.

In 2015, China experienced a slowdown in growth due to various factors, including weakening investments and industrial activity. However, the country is now focusing on domestic demand and structural reforms to drive future growth.

The global economy is expected to strengthen in 2016, with positive developments such as firming oil prices and improved financial markets. The IMF projects a gradual increase in global activity, with growth rates expected to rise in the coming years.

India, on the other hand, has emerged as a strong performer in the global economy, surpassing China in growth rate. The Indian economy grew at 7.6% in FY 2015-16, driven by manufacturing growth and favorable crude oil prices.

CEAT's consolidated sales have shown a consistent growth over the past five years, reflecting the company's resilience in a challenging economic environment.

Overall, despite global economic uncertainties, CEAT remains optimistic about its future prospects and is committed to driving sustainable growth in the tyre manufacturing industry.

India immensely benefited by the fall in global energy prices. As compared to that at the beginning of FY 2015-16, Indian basket of crude fell a little over 38.0% by the end of the fiscal. This helped India on two fronts. The nation could cut the import bill, which bettered the Current Account position. Deregulation helped slash the subsidies as well. India’s Current Account Deficit (CAD) for FY 2015-16 fell to 1.1% of GDP from 1.8% recorded a year before. Between April 2015 and March 2016, India’s exports fell 15.85% in US$ terms, while India’s imports declined by 15.28% as compared to those in the last fiscal.

In the Union Budget 2016-17, the Government has allocated close to ₹97,000 crores for the road sector under various schemes. Out of the major 70 projects stuck due to legacy problems, as described by the Government, it has revived almost 85% of them. It is estimated that the Government may approve the road construction projects of another 10,000 Kms. It has been trying to revive the Public Private Partnership (PPP) model for the infrastructure development. Although the implementation remains the key, thrust on building more roads and expanding the infrastructure of the country would promote higher growth in days to come. The Government also intends to double the farmers’ income by 2022. It is spending more on irrigation projects and wants to improve the rural incomes. All these efforts, if executed effectively, will help accelerate the industrial growth and in turn lead to overall higher economic growth.

## Global Tyre Industry

Trends in the automobile industry decide the growth trajectory for tyre companies to a large extent. Today, the global automakers are faced with a number of challenges such as rapidly changing macroeconomic conditions, shift in consumer behaviour, growing environmental concerns and unprecedented technological advancements among others. In the fiscal year under review, developed economies witnessed an uptick in the production and sales of vehicles, whereas emerging markets saw decelerating trends.

It is estimated that the world tyre market is likely to reach 2.9 billion units in 2017. This would make the global tyre industry worth US$276 billion. The centre of gravity in world trade has been shifting from mature markets to emerging economies. As a part of this broader trend, many emerging economies are likely to become manufacturing hubs, and the tyre industry is no exception.

Over the past 12 months, a sharp fall in prices of crude oil and natural rubber (NR) resulted in better profitability for tyre makers across the globe.

### Financial Ratings

Company’s long-term credit ratings were upgraded from A+ to AA- in FY 2015-16

# CEAT Annual Financial Report

# CEAT Annual Financial Report

Chinese tyre market: China is the world’s largest vehicle market. In 2015, China recorded a rise of 6% in Passenger Vehicle (PV) sales, while sales of Commercial Vehicles (CV) dropped 9%. China accounts for one-third of the global tyre industry. In FY 2015-16, the Chinese tyre market faced tough challenges due to overcapacities, anti-dumping probes, and weaker domestic demand.

Market and Product mix based on volumes in tonnage:

North American tyre market: In 2015, improving job market situation, cheaper credit, and lower energy prices boosted consumer confidence in the U.S. The U.S. auto sales had reached the previous peak in the year 2000. The North American region is likely to see higher tyre demand in the future.

European tyre market: Vehicle demand has been high in the European Union with 9.7% growth in auto sales in 2015. The outlook for tyre makers has improved as the demand for automobiles is expected to go up steadily in Europe.

Asia-Pacific: The growth prospects for China and India are likely to drive the tyre demand. However, dumping by Chinese tyre companies in export markets has put pricing under pressure.

Indian Tyre Industry: The Indian tyre industry caters to OEM, replacement, and export markets through four broad vehicle categories: Commercial Vehicles (CV), Passenger Vehicles (PV), Two-Wheelers (TW), and others, including tractors.

Within the two-wheeler segment, there was a drop in the growth of motorcycle and scooter tyres demand in FY 2015-16, on account of dip in rural consumption and corresponding reduced growth in the vehicle production.

Over the past seven quarters, tyre imports in India have been growing consistently. Truck Bus Radial (TBR) and two-wheeler tyre segments primarily witnessed a sharp rise in imports in the first nine months of FY 2015-16. Market share of TBR imports moved up to ~35% in the replacement market in FY 2015-16. Imports in the two-wheeler segment remain less worrying for Indian manufacturers, as imports here have a market share of only 4% at present.

China has been the biggest contributor to imports into India. This was on account of three main reasons namely India’s anti-dumping duties on Chinese tyres ended in early 2015, the U.S. imposed anti-dumping duty on Chinese tyres & the devaluation of Yuan made Chinese tyres cheaper. This has resulted into excess supply into Indian and global markets.

For Indian manufacturers, the situation in export markets remained tough in the past 12 months. In value terms, exports fell 12.8% in 9M FY 2015-16. Exports to both mature and emerging markets slid sharply. This drop in exports has been on account of weak global economic conditions, increasing Chinese competition globally, increased radialisation and relative currency depreciation in major importing countries from India.

The demand for CV tyres remained muted in FY 2015-16 because of slower progress on infrastructure projects, weaker than expected revival in private sector capex, and falling discretionary incomes in rural areas.

Tyre demand in the PCR and UVR segments has been consistent in FY 2015-16 and the demand is expected to be robust in FY 2016-17.

As far as the Farm segment tyres are concerned, the demand has been weak over the past couple of years. The year 2016, marked a second consecutive year of weak monsoon, resulting into weakening of the farm sentiments. Modest increase in Minimum Support Prices (MSP) and slow pickup in infrastructure and construction activities continued to impact the demand for the sector.

## Corporate Overview

After declining for three consecutive years, production of commercial vehicles picked up in FY 2015-16. As the April 17 deadline for the implementation of Bharat Stage IV emission norms neared, replacement of the older fleet provided a fillip to the production of Medium & Heavy Commercial Vehicles (M&HCV). Optimistic scenario in the infrastructure segment and sizeable exports also resulted in better performance of the M&HCV category.

Oct 15: Capacity utilisation and Capex

The capital expenditure of the Indian tyre industry is in keeping with the trends in the auto industry.

Nov 15: As a result of benign demand, higher imports and falling exports, the capacity utilisation of the Indian tyre industry has fallen for the first time in the past three years. The capacity utilisation for the TBB segment was the lowest while that in two-wheeler was the highest.

Dec 15: In FY 2015-16, the companies operating in India invested `4,890 crore in capacity additions. In FY 2016-17, the companies are expected to allocate `9,140 crore for further enhancing capacities. The industry is witnessing a shift of focus from the commercial to the consumer segments, owing to the expectations of a favourable monsoon and a demand recovery led by high discretionary income and higher internal accruals.

### Regulatory Environment

The tyre industry has been impacted by the cut in natural rubber production by farmers in Kerala. Production was cut because of low rubber prices, and while the Indian Government took several measures to protect the farmers’ interests, natural rubber prices continued falling, and output was curbed.

Some of the key measures taken by the Central & State Governments impacting raw material prices were:

- The Kerala Government announced a scheme in July 2015 of assured price of `150 per kg for rubber farmers, who are facing a crisis due to the sharp fall in natural rubber prices. The price support is available to

### Financial Statements

A recent survey reveals that China’s manufacturing sector expanded for the second month in a row in April but only marginally, raising doubts about the sustainability of this pick-up.

In the coming months, domestic natural rubber prices are expected to remain range-bound, driven by international price movements. Prices of crude derivatives, such as carbon black, rubber chemicals and synthetic rubber, are expected to largely move in line with the crude oil prices.

The present Government at the Centre had set a target of building 30 km of roads every day. According to a statement made in April 2016 by the transport minister, the present rate was the construction of 20 km of roads per day, and the aim was to touch the target of 30 km per day in the next few months. Greater connectivity would give a fillip to vehicle demand, resulting in greater demand for tyres in both OEM and replacement markets. Besides, massive road construction and infrastructure building activities will provide a boost to tyre demand from the construction industry.

There has been a hike in basic customs duty from 20% / ₹30 per kg, whichever is lower, to 25% / ₹30 per kg, whichever is lower, effective May 2015, to protect farmers' interest and regulate imports.

In Jan 2016, the Government introduced restrictions on the choice of ports with respect to the import of natural rubber. The import of Natural Rubber of all varieties is now allowed only through the ports of Chennai and Nhava Sheva (Jawaharlal Nehru Port).

Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) issued a notification in January 2016, whereby the facility for import of natural rubber under advance authorisations issued or revalidated on or after January 21, 2016, was not available till March 31, 2016.

## Opportunities and Threats for the Tyre Industry

Threats:

Chinese tyre manufacturers: Tyre imports from China to India may continue to grow at 10-12% over the next few years. The prevailing trend in the replacement market of low-cost upgradation from TBB (truck-bus bias) to TBR (truck-bus radial) tyres may continue even in the future. Strained exports from China to the U.S. market due to the imposition of anti-dumping duties and the devaluation of the Chinese Yuan could make our Asian neighbour go for more aggressive pricing in the export markets, giving stiffer competition to Indian tyre manufacturers.

Opportunities:

Anti-dumping Duty and Countervailing Duty (CvD) for OTR & Agricultural radial Tyres in US: The preliminary ruling from the US Department of Commerce (USDOC) for the OTR & Agricultural Radial Tyres CVD is out. The Anti-dumping duty case ruling has, meanwhile, been postponed to August. The final impact can be ascertained only post the anti-dumping ruling, which would happen in the second quarter of the next fiscal.

# CEAT Annual Financial Report

# CEAT Annual Financial Report

Volatility in Raw Material Prices: As a result of the sharp drop in natural rubber prices, and the resultant cut in production, the supply gap is likely to get wider in FY 2016-17. Lower inventory levels and the import restrictions on natural rubber are likely to pose challenges to domestic tyre manufacturers. Rupee volatility and heavy fluctuations in crude oil prices may exacerbate the situation.

## Industry Outlook

A broad-based economic recovery led by a massive push to infra spends, good monsoon, higher urban discretionary incomes, and a rural income turnaround may provide Indian tyre makers with exciting opportunities in OEM as well as replacement markets. The tyre demand is likely to be higher by 3.5-5.5% in FY 2016-17 and may improve further to 8%-10% in FY 2017-18. China may continue to pose a threat to Indian companies in the domestic TBR market and also in the export markets serviced.

In total, the Company’s manufacturing capacity is more than 1000 MT/day. The Company operates in India through a robust distribution network of 4300+ dealers, 33 regional offices, 400+ CEAT franchisees and 250+ distributors.

The Company’s consolidated sales have grown over the past five years at a CAGR of 10%. The Company has achieved a remarkable turnaround in profitability over the past three years mainly by improving its product mix, lower finance costs and moderate raw material costs. With increasing capacities, robust focus on R&D, new product launches, fast-paced brand investments, growing channel strengths and a stronger balance sheet, the Company is well positioned for a sustained growth trajectory.

As far as the market segmentation is concerned, out of the Company’s total Revenue pie, the replacement market, OEM and exports account for 64%, 23% and 13%, respectively.

## Changing Product Mix

The CEAT brand has always been relevant with a high top of-the-mind recall. The growth strategy for the Company is that we set up at Halol in 2011. The distribution network was pivoted around having great products and enhancing the customer experience during and after the purchase. The Company is present in all categories of tyres, from commercial vehicles to cars to two wheelers. Within these, the passenger segment (comprising passenger cars, utility vehicles and two wheeler tyres) has emerged as a high growth segment. This has been on account of the GDP growth, growing disposable income, poor public transportation and lower passenger vehicle penetration in India. We have therefore decided to enhance our focus towards the passenger segment.

With focus on these categories and safety as the core premise, we continuously churned out technologically superior products, thanks to the contemporary and state-of-the-art R&D Centre.

### Changing Product Mix (%)

The revenues from the segment in the total pie have gone up from 15% in FY 2010-11 to 39% in FY 2015-16. In terms of revenues, the two wheeler segments witnessed phenomenal CAGRs of 32%, respectively, between FY 2010-11 and FY 2015-16 whereas, for passenger cars and utility vehicles put together, grew at a CAGR of 34% for the corresponding period.

The Company’s endeavour is to have a further increase the share of the Passenger Segment. In the Commercial Segment, the focus will continue to be on improving productivity and continuing to grow and develop radial capability. In a step towards further diversification, the Company has initiated the construction of a greenfield manufacturing facility, through its 100% subsidiary, CEAT Specialty Tyres Limited (CSTL), in Ambernath, Maharashtra. CSTL will concentrate on Off Highway Tyres primarily with the focus on exports.

The Company believes it can sustain the benefits of its improved product mix through more intensive efforts put into building brand loyalty, adding more OEM relationships, expanding the distribution network, and maintaining the tempo in new product launches. CEAT’s long-term goals on products, markets, and margins are supported by watertight strategies.

Business Risks & Mitigation Strategies

Commodity Price Volatility

This risk is mitigated by the Company through a commodity desk that gathers intelligence on the market and guides procurement. A robust vendor management system is in place to strengthen mutually beneficial long-term relations with suppliers. Meanwhile, the Company continues to explore the possibility of new sourcing partners to widen its supplier base.

Competition

Increased competition from other players in the industry may affect growth potential. Through deep domain knowledge, technology prowess, branding and reach, the Company has created strong differentiators in terms of quality and product offerings. This mitigates the threat posed by this risk to a considerable extent.

Radialisation in Truck & Bus Segment

A faster than expected increase in radialisation in the truck and bus tyre segment may impact margins. To mitigate this risk, the Company is converting its truck and bus bias capacities into non-truck segments that have higher demand. The focus is also on penetrating the overseas markets where acceptability for bias tyres is higher.

Industrial Relations

Increased labour activism across the country may pose a challenge to the Company’s operations. To mitigate this risk, the Company continually engages with the workforce to win their trust and strengthen the labour relations at its manufacturing facilities.

Environment, Occupational Health & Safety

## Corporate Overview

The OEM segment showed a good growth over the previous year. There was an increase in sales volume with the existing OEM customers. During the current year, the Company has entered into association with new OEMs like Renault, Nissan, Honda & Royal Enfield. The Company is also associated with Renault Kwid and Mahindra TUV 300 during the current year. These new entries gave impetus to the growth of the revenue in OEM segment to a certain extent. Further, the Export segment displayed de-growth of around 24.78% over the previous year on account of increasing radialization, relatively higher currency depreciation in most of our exporting countries and an increase in sales of Chinese products.

There has been a revision in the royalty agreements with the Joint Venture in Sri Lanka leading to incremental royalty revenue during the year.

### Cost of Materials / Finished Goods Consumed Analysis

Cost of materials / finished goods consumed comprises of the following items:

|Particulars|FY 2015-16|FY 2014-15|Change|Change %|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Cost of materials consumed|3,04,105.20|3,36,261.03|(32,155.83)|(9.56)|
|Purchase of stock-in-trade|13,766.07|11,433.10|2,332.97|20.41|
|Changes in Inventory|(979.23)|5,638.60|(6,617.83)|(117.37)|

The raw material prices have further declined during the year. As a result, the cost of material consumed as a percentage of sale of products has declined to 55.78% for the year as compared to 61.94% for the previous year.

### Employee Benefits Expense Analysis

Employee benefits expense comprises of the following:

|Particulars|FY 2015-16|FY 2014-15|Change|Change %|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Salaries, wages and bonus|34,542.57|30,515.28|4,027.29|13.20|
|Contribution to provident fund and other funds|1,885.10|1,845.91|39.19|2.12|
|Gratuity expenses|414.31|2,051.24|(1,636.93)|(79.80)|
|Staff welfare expenses|4,037.96|3,476.83|561.13|16.14|

Increase in salaries, wages and bonus by 13.20% is majorly on account of incremental performance bonus given to employees during the year 2015-16. The increase in staff welfare expenses was an outcome of the introduction of new staff welfare policies. The gratuity expenses of the last year showed a surge due to revised higher wages pursuant to long-term wage settlement and a decrease in the applicable discounting rate from 9.00% to 7.85%. However, the discounting rate movement was not significant in 2015-16. The applicable discounting rate has moved from 7.85% to 7.75%. The contribution for gratuity has an inverse relation with the movement in the applicable discounting rate as a lower interest rate requires a higher contribution to provide for comparable future liability.

### Other Expenses Analysis

Other expenses primarily include the following expenses:

|Particulars|FY 2015-16|FY 2014-15|Change|Change %|
|---|---|---|---|---|

Total other expenses as a percentage of sales has gone up to 20.23% in the current year from 17.85% in the previous year. Conversion charges represent the charges paid to various outsourcing vendors working on job work basis i.e. converting the raw materials to various two/three wheeler tyres, etc. The Company has focused on the two/three wheeler segment and hence there was also increase in the volumes produced through the outsourcing partners. Sales of two/ three wheeler has grown by 19.77% in revenue and from 23.32% to 27.76% in a mix of total revenue. Consequently conversion charges have increased by 25.36 % vs previous year.

Power and fuel charges reduction is an outcome of reduction in the furnace oil prices by nearly 50% and Gas prices by nearly 25%. Freight and delivery charges have increased on account of changes in the sales mix and volumes. Over the last few years, there is a strategic focus to increase the product mix in passenger segment like two/ three wheeler, PCR & UVR. These categories require higher storage space and are lower in density, thus requiring excess travel resulting in higher freight charges which is a structural shift in the freight charges. There was also slight change in the diesel prices during the year which impacted the freight charges to some extent. The Company has been consciously focusing on enhancing the brand equity through effective marketing. This is witnessed by the innovative ad campaigns, continued association with IPL, association with cricketers for promoting CEAT logo on to their bats, etc. which resulted in the increased advertisement & marketing expenditure. Professional & consultancy charges showed a steep growth on account of services availed in the strategic space.

Rebates and discounts are mainly on account of incentives given to customers for prompt payments which has shown an upward movement. Loss on sale /discard of assets has displayed a surge over the previous year. This is mainly because of the asset discarded in the process of plant set up for Halol Phase II. Further, the company has the policy to procure and keep in custody insurance spares for major machineries. As these spares can be only used in connection with a particular plant & machinery and its use is expected to be irregular, these spares are eligible for capitalization on procurement. On actual usage of these spares, the value of worn out spares are charged to P&L. The bank charges has shown a drastic decline on account of reduced borrowings in the current year vis-à-vis previous year.

## EBITDA (including other income and before exceptional items) analysis

The EBITDA has gone up by 21.22% for the year, while EBITDA margin as a percentage of total revenue increased to 14.84% in the current year as compared to 12.17% for previous year. The increase in EBITDA is largely on account of lower material cost, improved product mix (higher mix of passenger segment viz. two / three wheeler, passenger car radial, etc) to 39.25% of total revenue as against 33.70% in the previous year and lower raw material cost.

During the year, the average borrowings reduced on account of better profitability and effective use of working capital. The scheduled repayment of old loans coupled with prepayment of some of the high interest bearing loans also reduced the borrowing levels. The Company issued Non-Convertible Debentures on the terms linked with SBI base rate (currently 9.40% p.a. as on March 31, 2016) to refinance these loans bearing higher interest rates. The Company increased the frequency and amount of commercial paper issued during the year as compared to the previous year, being the cheaper source of short term funding. The Company took conscious steps to shift from high cost borrowings to low cost borrowings. The lower interest rates, negotiation of finance charges and improved credit rating of the Company reduced the borrowing cost for the Company on the overall level.

Intangible assets consist of software, brand acquisitions and technical knowhow.

### Capital Work in Progress

Capital work in progress mostly includes the project capital expenditure of phase II of the radial tyre factory under construction in Halol, Gujarat, India, Nagpur project of the Company, Bangladesh subsidiary’s bias tyre factory and Ambernath factory of Company’s subsidiary CEAT Specialty Tyres Limited.

The increase during the year pertains to Halol Phase II tyre project, Nagpur project and the factory under construction for the Company’s subsidiary CEAT Specialty Tyres Limited.

### Goodwill on Consolidation

The goodwill on consolidation of `2,049.95 Lacs represents the excess of the acquisition cost over the book value of the assets of the Company’s three subsidiaries / joint venture, being `2,278.52 Lacs in Sri Lanka Joint Venture (FY 2009-10), `93.51 Lacs in Rado Tyres Limited (FY 2013-14) and `0.92 Lacs in CEAT Specialty Limited (FY 2014-15), as reduced by capital reserve of `323.00 Lacs arising on the consolidation of the Company’s Bangladesh subsidiary, CEAT AKKHAN Limited.

The capital reserve arose on the second tranche of equity investment in CEAT AKKHAN Limited by the Company thereby reducing its stake to 70% while the balance 30% was subscribed by JV partner A.K.Khan and Company Limited. The exchange fluctuation as on the said second tranche of equity infusion, followed by accumulated losses resulted in the capital reserve. Prior to this, CEAT Limited had 100% stake in CEAT AKKHAN Limited.

During the year, the goodwill and capital reserve on consolidation has been restated at the exchange rates as on March 31, 2016 for the Srilanka Joint venture and Bangladesh subsidiary. The movement is on account of the foreign exchange fluctuations.

## Short-term Loans and Advances

(Amounts in Lacs)

|Particulars|31.03.2016|31.03.2015|Change|Change %|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Security Deposits|49.67|152.72|(103.05)|(67.48)|
|Advance Receivable in Cash or Kind|3,940.50|2,082.42|1,858.08|89.23|

|Prepaid Expenses|882.49|541.11|341.38|63.09|

Security deposits represent the current portion of the earnest money deposits kept with various government bodies.

Advances receivable in cash or kind or for value to be received majorly include advances to material vendors, export benefits receivable, prepaid expenses, rent deposits, etc. The increase is majorly on account of the increase in the export benefit receivable as of March 31, 2016.

Balance with statutory/government authorities mostly include octroi refunds, cenvat receivable, service tax receivable, advance customs duty, etc. The increase is mainly on account of cenvat receivable on the capex incurred for Halol Phase II project as well as Nagpur project. As per the Cenvat Credit Rules 2004, the cenvat credit on capital goods is restricted to 50% in the first year.

Prepaid expenses are unamortized expenses towards various license fees, finance charges, insurance charges, and other expenses in the normal course of business. The increase is on account of prepaid insurance expenses since the renewal of insurance policies was aligned at the year-end to have uniformity in the period of all the insurance policies.

## Other Current Assets

(Amounts in Lacs)

|Particulars|31.03.2016|31.03.2015|Change|Change %|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Interest Receivable|158.97|194.70|(35.73)|(18.35)|
|Recoverable Against Fire Loss|470.00|442.29|27.71|6.27|
|Revaluation of Hedging Instrument|160.11|899.99|(739.88)|(82.21)|
|Other Receivable|128.32|113.50|14.82|13.06|

Interest receivable primarily includes interest earned on margin money deposited.

The amount recoverable against fire loss relates to the estimated insurance claim towards accidental fire to the machinery imported for Halol Phase II. The claim is lodged with the New India Assurance and is considered good and recoverable from the insurance company. Whereas the previous year's claim receivable was due to the incidence of fire in raw material stores of our Bhandup plant in FY 2013-14. The same got settled during the current year.

Revaluation of hedging instrument signifies mark-to-market short-term valuation of the hedging instruments as of March 31, 2016. The short-term buyer’s credit was nil as of March 31, 2016, and the ECB loan from ICICI Bank, among the foreign currency loan, was prepaid during the current year. Hence there was a corresponding reduction in revaluation gain on the hedging instruments.

# CEAT Annual Financial Report

The Commercial Vehicle (CV) segment is expected to clock single digit volume growth in FY 2016-17, with a Y-o-Y volume growth for M&HCVs expected to moderate to 8-10% from almost 30% levels in FY 2015-16. The key driver for the segment’s growth would be in demand for high tonnage vehicles as fleet owners seek to minimise their per ton transportation cost by taking advantage of improved road infrastructure in the country. The focus of Union Budget 2016 on infrastructure improvement is also expected to give a boost to M&HCV segment.

Motorcycles are likely to exhibit annual volume growth of ~3% in FY 2016-17, depending on behavior of the rural consumer. Scooters are however expected to continue to show a decent volume growth backed by urban-centric demand. However, the growth rate is expected to remain at 12% in FY 2016-17.

## Dividend

The Board at its meeting held on March 16, 2016 declared an interim dividend of ` 11.5 per equity share of ` 10.00 each (i.e.115%) for the financial year ended March 31, 2016 and recommends the Members to confirm it as final dividend for the year ended March 31, 2016.

The Company had also planned to set up a greenfield project, with an initial capacity of 120 MT/day, to manufacture two-three wheeler tyres in Buti Bori near Nagpur in the State of Maharashtra.

As a result, the Company expects to grow in FY 2016-17, on account of the increased demand, with a short term downward bias in profit margins, due to an increase in raw material prices from the FY 2015-16 levels.

### Material Changes and Commitments

## Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2016

1. Corporate Information

CEAT Limited is a public company domiciled in India and incorporated under the provisions of the Companies Act, 1956. The Company's principal business is manufacturing of automotive tyres, tubes, and flaps. The Company started operations in 1958 as CEAT Tyres of India Limited and was renamed as CEAT Limited in 1990. The Company caters to both domestic and international markets.

2. Basis of Preparation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

A) Basis of accounting and preparation of financial statements

The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles in India ("Indian GAAP"). The Company has prepared these financial statements to comply in all material respects with the accounting standards notified under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, read together with paragraph 7 of the Companies (Accounts) Rules 2014. The financial statements have been prepared on an accrual basis and under the historical cost convention except for land, building, and plant and equipment acquired before 2007 which are carried at revalued amounts and derivative financial instruments which have been measured at fair value.

B) Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Indian GAAP requires the management to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent liabilities, at the end of the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on the management's best knowledge of current events and actions, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in the outcomes requiring a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities in future periods.

C) Tangible Fixed Assets and Intangible assets

i) Tangible Assets

a) Fixed assets are stated at the cost of acquisition or construction or revalued amount whichever is applicable, net of accumulated depreciation/amortization and impairment losses, if any.

b) The cost comprises the cost of acquisition, borrowing cost, and any attributable cost of bringing the asset to the condition for its intended use. Cost also includes...

# CEAT Annual Financial Report 2016

# Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2016

Direct expenses incurred up to the date of capitalisation / commissioning. Any trade discounts and rebates are deducted in arriving at the purchase price.

Machinery spares procured along with the plant and machinery or subsequently and whose use is expected to be irregular are capitalised separately, if cost of such spares is known and depreciated fully over the residual useful life of the related plant and machinery. If the cost of such spares is not known particularly when procured along with the mother plant, these are capitalised and depreciated along with the mother plant. The written down value (WDV) of the spares is charged as revenue expenditure in the year in which such spares are consumed. Similarly, the value of such spares, procured and consumed in a particular year is charged as revenue expenditure in that year itself.

Subsequent expenditure related to an item of fixed asset is added to its book value only if it increases the future benefits from the existing asset beyond its previously assessed standards of performance.

All other expenses on existing fixed assets, including day-to-day repair and maintenance expenditure, are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss for the period during which such expenses are incurred.

Replacement of any part of plant and machinery, which are of capital nature, are capitalised along with the main plant and machinery and cost of the replaced part is written off. In case the cost of replaced part is not identifiable, the equal value of replacement is deducted from the existing gross block of that asset.

Gains and losses arising from disposal/derecognition of fixed assets which are carried at cost are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

Tangible assets not ready for the intended use on the date of balance sheet are disclosed as “Capital work-in-progress”.

In case of revaluation of fixed assets, any revaluation surplus is credited to the revaluation reserve, except to the extent that it reverses a revaluation decrease of the same asset previously recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss, in which case the increase is recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss. A revaluation deficit is recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss, except to the extent that it offsets an existing surplus on the same asset recognized in the asset revaluation reserve.

## Intangible Assets

Intangible Assets are stated at cost of acquisition or construction, less accumulated amortization and impairment, if any.

## Borrowing Cost

Borrowing cost includes interest, fees and amortization of other ancillary costs incurred in connection with the arrangement of borrowings. Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of or construction of qualifying assets are capitalized as part of the cost of such assets. A qualifying asset is one that necessarily takes substantial period of time to get ready for intended use. All other borrowing costs are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

## Depreciation

### Tangible Assets

Leasehold land – amortized on a straight line basis over the period of the lease ranging from 95 years – 99 years.

Depreciation on fixed assets is calculated on a straight line basis using the rates arrived at based on the useful lives estimated by the management.

The Company has used the following rates to provide depreciation on its fixed assets. The identified components are depreciated.

# CEAT Limited - Annual Report 2015-16

# CEAT Limited - Annual Report 2015-16

## Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2016

Over their useful lives, the remaining asset is depreciated over the life of the principal asset. Management also estimates the residual values of the fixed assets.

### Asset Class

### Useful life

### Depreciation is not recorded on capital work-in-progress until construction and installation are complete.

|Asset Class|Useful life|
|---|---|
|Buildings|50 years - 60 years|
|Plant & Machinery|15 years - 20 years|
|Moulds|6 years|
|Computers|3 years|
|Furniture & Fixtures|10 years|
|Office Equipment|5 years|
|Motor Vehicles|8 years|
|Carpeted Roads- RCC|10 years|
|Computer Servers|6 years|
|Electrical Installations|20 years|
|Hand Carts, Trolleys|15 years|

The management has estimated, supported by independent assessment by professionals, the useful lives of the assets in various classes.

The management believes that the depreciation rates fairly reflect its estimation of the useful lives.

#### Impairment of tangible and intangible assets:

The Company assesses at each Balance Sheet date whether there is any indication that an asset...

# CEAT Annual Financial Report

# Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2016

May be impaired. If any such indication exists, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the asset. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s (CGU) net selling price and its value in use. The recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. If such recoverable amount of the asset or the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs is less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable amount. The reduction is treated as an impairment loss and is recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss. After impairment, depreciation is provided on the revised carrying amount of the asset over its remaining useful life.

The Company bases its impairment calculations of detailed budgets and forecast calculations which are prepared separately for each of the Company’s cash-generating units to which the individual assets are allocated. These budgets and forecast calculations are generally covering a period of 5 years. For a longer period, a long-term growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the 5th year.

Impairment losses for continuing operations, including impairment on inventories, are recognized on the Statement of Profit and Loss, except for the previously revalued tangible fixed asset, where the revaluation was taken to revaluation reserve. In this case, the impairment is recognized in revaluation reserve up to the amount of any previous revaluation.

## Investments

Investments, which are readily realizable and intended to be held for not more than one year from the date on which such investments are made, are classified as current investments. All other investments are classified as long-term investments. On initial recognition, all investments are measured at cost. The cost comprises purchase price and directly attributable acquisition charges such as brokerage, fees, and duties. If an investment is acquired, or partly acquired, by the issue of shares or other securities, the acquisition cost is the fair value of the securities issued.

## Inventories

Raw materials, components, stores, and spares are valued at lower of cost and net realizable value. However, materials and other items held for use in the production of inventories are not written down below cost if the finished products in which they will be incorporated are expected to be sold at or above cost. Cost is determined on a weighted average basis.

Work-in-progress and finished goods are valued at lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost includes direct materials and labor and a proportion of manufacturing overheads based on normal operating capacity. Cost of finished goods includes excise duty. Cost is determined on a weighted average basis.

Stock-in-trade is valued at lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost includes the cost of purchase and other costs incurred in bringing.

# CEAT Limited - Annual Report 2015-16

# CEAT Limited - Annual Report 2015-16

## Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2016

The inventories to their present location and condition. Cost is determined on a weighted average basis.

Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

### Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Company and revenue can be reliably measured. The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognized:

1. Sale of Goods: Revenue from sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership are passed on to the customer. Sales taxes and Value Added Taxes (VAT) are excluded from revenue.
2. Interest: Interest income is recognized on a time proportion basis taking into account the amount outstanding and the applicable interest rate.
3. Dividends: Dividend income is recognized when the Company’s right to receive dividend is established by the reporting date.
4. Royalty and technology development fees: Royalty and technology development fees income are accounted for as per the terms of the contract.

### Government grants and export incentives

Government grants are recognised when there is reasonable assurance that the Company will comply with the conditions attached to them and the grants will be received. Export incentives such as focus market scheme, focus products scheme, and special focus market scheme, etc., are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss as a part of other operating revenues.

#### Foreign currency translation

Foreign currency transactions and balances:

1. Initial recognition: Foreign currency transactions are recorded in the reporting currency by applying the exchange rate between the reporting currency and the foreign currency at the date of the transaction.
2. Conversion: Foreign currency monetary items are retranslated using the exchange rate prevailing on the reporting date.
3. Exchange differences: All exchange gains and losses arising out of translation/restatement are accounted for in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

#### Forward exchange contracts

Forward exchange contracts entered into to hedge foreign currency exposure as at Balance Sheet date. The premium or discount arising at the inception of forward exchange contracts is amortized and recognized as income or expense over the life of the contract.

#### Leases

Where the Company is lessee:

- Finance leases: Finance leases, which effectively transfer to the Company substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are capitalized at the inception of the lease term at the lower of the fair value of the leased property and present value of minimum lease payments.

# CEAT Annual Financial Report

# Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2016

A leased asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis for example, a reduction in future payment or a cash refund. If there is no reasonable certainty that the Company will obtain the ownership by the end of the lease term, the capitalized asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset or lease term, whichever is earlier. Leases, where the lessor effectively retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the leased item, are classified as operating leases. Operating lease payments are recognized as an expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

## Corporate Overview

The Company provides for retirement benefits in the form of gratuity. The Company’s liability towards these benefits is determined on the basis of actuarial valuation using Projected Unit Credit Method at the date of balance sheet. Actuarial gains/losses are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which they occur.

### Compensated absences

Accumulated leave, which is expected to be utilized within the next 12 months, is treated as short-term employee benefit and shown under short-term provision in the Balance Sheet. The Company measures the expected cost of such absences as the additional amount that it expects to pay as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the reporting date. The Company treats accumulated leave expected to be carried forward beyond twelve months as long-term employee benefit for measurement purposes and this is shown under long-term provisions in the Balance Sheet.

## Strategic Review

Research costs are expensed as incurred. Development expenditure incurred on individual projects is recognized as an intangible asset when the Company can demonstrate technical feasibility, intention to complete the asset, ability to use or sell the asset, how the asset will generate future economic benefits, availability of adequate resources, and ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during development.

### Employee benefits

Retirement benefits in the form of provident fund, Superannuation, Employees State Insurance Contribution, and Labour Welfare Fund are defined contribution schemes. The Company recognizes contribution payable to these funds/schemes as expenditure when an employee renders the related service. If the contribution payable exceeds the contribution already paid, the deficit payable to the funds/schemes is recognized as a liability after deducting the contribution already paid.

## Statutory Reports

The Company presents the leave as a current liability in the balance sheet, to the extent it does not have an unconditional right to defer its settlement for 12 months after the reporting date. Where the Company has the unconditional legal and contractual right to defer the settlement for a period beyond 12 months, the same is presented as a non-current liability.

### Termination benefits

The Company recognizes termination benefits as a liability and an expense when the Company has a present obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.

# CEAT Limited - Annual Report 2015-16

# CEAT Limited - Annual Report 2015-16

## Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2016

Present value of the future cash flows using the discount rate determined by reference to market yields at the Balance Sheet date on Government bonds.

### Taxes on Income

Current tax: Current Tax is determined as the amount of tax payable on taxable income for the year as per the provisions of Income Tax Act, 1961.

Minimum alternate tax (MAT) paid in a year is charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss as current tax. The Company recognizes MAT credit available as an asset only to the extent that there is convincing evidence that the Company will pay normal income tax during the specified period.

For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the net profit or loss for the period attributable to equity shareholders and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares.

### Provisions and Contingent Liabilities

A provision is recognized when the Company has a present obligation as a result of past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.

A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose existence will be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events beyond the control of the Company.

### Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash comprises cash in hand and demand deposit with banks. Cash and cash equivalents for the purposes of cash flow statement comprise cash at bank and cash in hand and short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less.

### Derivative Instruments and Hedge Accounting

The Company uses derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency forward contracts to hedge foreign currency risk arising from future transactions in respect of which firm commitments are made or which are highly probable forecast transactions.

# CEAT Annual Financial Report 2016

# Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2016

The Company also uses cross currency interest rate swaps (CCIRS) to hedge interest rate risk arising from variable rate loans and cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge both foreign currency loan and interest risk arising from foreign exchange fluctuations and variable rate loans. The Company designates these forward contracts and interest rate swaps in a hedging relationship by applying the hedge accounting principles of AS-30 “Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement”.

For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as:

1. Fair value hedges when hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment.
2. Cash flow hedges when hedging the exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognized asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction or the foreign currency risk in an unrecognized firm commitment.

At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Company formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which the Company wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the Company will assess the effectiveness of changes in the hedging instrument’s fair value in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item’s fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk.

## Corporate Overview

The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognized directly under shareholders fund in the hedging reserve, while any ineffective portion is recognized immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss. The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts as hedges of its exposure to foreign currency risk in forecasted transactions and firm commitments. The ineffective portion relating to foreign currency contracts is recognized immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

Amounts recognized in the hedging reserve are transferred to the Statement of Profit and Loss when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when the hedged income or expense is recognized or when a forecast sale occurs. If the forecast transaction or firm commitment is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in the hedging reserve is transferred to the Statement of Profit and Loss. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, any cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in the hedging reserve remains in the hedging reserve until the forecast transaction or firm commitment affects profit or loss.

## Strategic Review

If the forecast transaction or firm commitment is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in the hedging reserve is transferred to the Statement of Profit and Loss. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, any cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in the hedging reserve remains in the hedging reserve until the forecast transaction or firm commitment affects profit or loss.

## Other derivatives

Derivative financial instruments which are not designated as cash flow hedge have been measured at fair value as per AS-30 and the loss / (gain) on the same is charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss.

## Statutory Reports

The estimated liability for warranty is recorded when products are sold. These estimates are established using historical information on the nature, frequency and average cost of obligations and management estimates regarding possible future incidence based on corrective actions on product failure. The timing of outflows will vary as and when the obligation will arise, being typically up to three years.

## Financial Statements

The Company’s operations comprise of only one business segment “Automotive Tyres, Tubes & Flaps” as its primary segment. The analysis of geographical segments is based on the areas in which the Company operates. The accounting policies adopted for segment reporting are in conformity with the accounting policies of the Company.

Hence, the Company has to take prior permission of the appropriate authority for removal / transfer of any asset (falling under the above schemes) from Nashik plant. In case of violation of terms & conditions, the Company is required to refund the entire loan / benefit along with the interest @ 22.50% on account of sales-tax deferral loan and @ 15% on account of octroi refund. (Refer note 19(2)(c)).

d. Demands and disputes considered as “Remote” by the Company:

1. The Company has been served with a Show Cause cum Demand Notice from the DGCEI (Directorate General of Central Excise Intelligence) Mumbai, on the ground that, the activity of making tyre set, i.e. inserting Tubes and Flaps inside the Tyres and tied up through Polypropylene Straps, amounts to manufacture / pre-packaged commodity under Section 2(f)(iii) of Central Excise Act, read with Section 2(l) of the Legal Metrology Act, 2009. Accordingly, the authorities worked out the differential duty amounting to ₹8,417.79 Lacs i.e., the amount of duty already paid on the basis of transaction value and duty payable on the basis of MRP under Section 4A, for the period from April-2011 to March-2015. The Company believes that Set of TT / TTF(Tyre Tube / Tyre Tube and Flap) is not pre-packaged commodity in terms of provisions of Legal Metrology Act, 2009. The Company has a strong case on the ground that, the said issue has been clarified by the Controller of the Legal Metrology Department vide its letter dated May 1, 1991 that “Tyre with tube & flaps tied with three thin polythene strips may not be treated as a pre-packed commodity within the meaning of rule 2(l) of the Standards of Weights and Measures (Packaged Commodities), Rules, 1977”. The above clarification has been re-affirmed vide letter dated November 16, 1992 by the Legal Metrology authorities.

2. The Competition Commission of India (CCI) had, while considering the representation made by All India Tyres Dealers Federation (AITDF) made a prima facie view that the major players of tyre industry (including the Company) had some understanding amongst themselves, especially in the replacement market, as they did not pass the benefit of corresponding reduction in prices of major raw material inputs for the period subsequent to the year 2011-12. According to CCI, this practice is in violation of the Competition Act, 2002 (“the Act”). Therefore, CCI had, vide its order passed on June 24, 2014 under Section 26(1) of the Act, directed the Office of the Director General (DG) to investigate the said alleged violation of the Act. DG submitted its Investigation Report to CCI in December 2015, based on which CCI passed an order on February 18, 2016 directing the said tyre manufacturers to file their suggestions / objections by May 5, 2016. The Company’s decision to change the price is purely a business decision which depends upon many factors like cost of production, brand value perception, and profit margin of each product, quality perception of each product in the market, demand and supply situation of each product category and market potential and market shares targets of various product categories etc. In view of the above the Company believes that it has a strong case.

## Strategic Review

# CEAT Annual Financial Report

# CEAT Annual Financial Report

Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) and the Standards on Auditing, both, issued by Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, and deemed to be prescribed under section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control over financial reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

## Corporate Overview

In our opinion, the Holding Company and its subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in India, have maintained in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system over financial reporting and such internal financial controls over financial reporting were operating effectively as at March 31, 2016, based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Holding Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.

## Strategic Review

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls system over financial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.

## Statutory Reports

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditor in terms of their report referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal financial controls system over financial reporting.

## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2016

1. Corporate Information

CEAT Limited is a public Company domiciled in India and incorporated under the provisions of the Companies Act, 1956. The Company’s principal business is manufacturing of automotive tyres, tubes and flaps. The Company started operations in 1958 as CEAT Tyres of India Limited and was renamed as CEAT Limited in 1990. The Company caters to both domestic and international markets.

2. Basis of Consolidation and Significant Accounting Policies

A) Basis of Accounting and preparation of financial statements

The Consolidated financial statements have been prepared and presented under the historical cost convention and on the accrual basis of accounting, unless stated otherwise and comply with the mandatory Accounting Standards (‘AS’) notified under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read together with paragraph 7 of the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014 and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. The financial statements have been prepared on an accrual basis and under the historical cost convention except for land, building and plant and equipments acquired before 2007 which are carried at revalued amounts and derivative financial instruments which have been measured at fair value.

The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of financial statements are consistent with those of the previous year, except for the change in accounting policy explained below.

Component Accounting

The group has adopted component accounting as required under schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 from April 1, 2015. The group was previously not identifying components of fixed assets separately for depreciation purpose; rather a single useful life / depreciation rate was used to depreciate each item of fixed asset.

Due to application of schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013, the group has changed the manner of depreciation for its fixed assets. Now, the group identifies and determines cost of each component / part of the asset separately, if the component / part has a cost which is significant to the total cost to the asset and having useful life that is materially different from that of the remaining assets. These components are depreciated over their useful lives; the remaining asset is depreciated over the life of the principal asset. The group has used the transitional provision of schedule II to adjust the impact of component accounting arising on its first application.

If a component has zero remaining useful life on the date of component accounting becoming effecting i.e. April 1, 2015, its carrying amount after retaining any residual value is charged to the general reserve. The carrying amount of other components i.e. components whose remaining useful life is not nil as on April 1, 2015, is depreciated over their remaining useful lives.

Had the Company continued to use the earlier policy of depreciating fixed assets, its financial statements for the period would have been impacted as below:

- Depreciation for the current period would have been lower by `523.16 Lacs. Profit for the current period would have been higher by `377.48 Lacs (net of tax impact of `145.68 Lacs). Fixed assets would correspondingly have been higher by `523.16 Lacs.
- On the date of component accounting becoming applicable, i.e. April 1, 2015, the amount of `586.72 Lacs (net of deferred tax `274.52 Lacs) has been directly adjusted against retained earnings on account of depreciable value as on April 1, 2015 for the components having zero remaining useful life.

The consolidated financial statements are prepared using uniform accounting policy for all like transaction and event under similar circumstances. The consolidated financial statements relate to CEAT Limited (the Company) and its subsidiary companies (referred to as “the Group”).

ii) Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Indian GAAP requires the management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent liabilities, at the end of the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on the management’s best knowledge of current events and actions, uncertainty about these assumption and estimates could result in the outcomes requiring a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities in future periods.

iii) Principles of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the following basis:

# CEAT Annual Financial Report 2016

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

for the year ended March 31, 2016

## Corporate Overview

The financial statements of the subsidiary companies used in the consolidation are drawn up to the same reporting date as of the Company i.e. year ended March 31, 2016.

The financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary companies have been combined on a line-by-line basis by adding together like items of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. The intra-group balances and intra-group transactions and unrealised profits have been fully eliminated.

The financial statements of the joint venture companies have been combined by using proportionate consolidation method in accordance with Accounting Standard 27 – “Financial reporting of interests in joint ventures” and accordingly, venture’s share of each of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of jointly controlled entity is reported as separate line items in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

### Goodwill and Capital Reserve

The excess of cost to the Company of its investments in the subsidiary companies over its share of equity of the subsidiary companies, at the dates on which the investments in the subsidiary are made, is recognised as ‘Goodwill’ being an asset in the consolidated financial statements. Goodwill arising out of consolidation is not amortized. However, the same is tested for impairment at each Balance Sheet date. Alternatively, where the share of equity in the subsidiary companies as on the date of investment is in excess of cost of investment of the Company, it is recognised as ‘Capital Reserve’ and shown under the head ‘Reserves and Surplus’, in the consolidated financial statements.

### Minority Interest

Minority Interest in the net assets of Subsidiaries consists of:

- The amount of equity attributable to the minorities at the date on which investment in Subsidiary is made.
- The minorities’ share of movements in equity since the date the parent-subsidiary relationship came into existence.

### Foreign Subsidiary

Revenue items have been consolidated at the average rate of foreign exchange prevailing during the year, where such rates approximate the exchange rate at the date of transaction. The assets are translated at the closing rate. Exchange differences arising on monetary and non-monetary items that in substance forms part of the Company’s net investments in non-integral foreign operation are accumulated in the Foreign Currency Translation Reserve (FCTR) and shown under the head Reserve and Surplus.

The group bases its impairment calculations of detailed budgets and forecast calculations which are prepared separately for each of the Company’s cash-generating units to which the individual assets are allocated. These budgets and forecast calculations are generally covering a period of 5 years. For longer period, a long term growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the 5th year.

Impairment losses for continuing operations, including impairment on inventories, are recognised on the Statement of Profit and Loss, except for the previously revalued tangible fixed asset, where the revaluation was taken to revaluation reserve. In this case, the impairment is recognised in revaluation reserve up to the amount of any previous revaluation.

An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognized impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the group estimates the asset’s or cash-generating unit’s recoverable amount. A previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized.

## Investments

Investments, which are readily realizable and intended to be held for not more than one year from the date on which such investments are made, are classified as current investments. All other investments are classified as long-term investments.

3. Dividends: Dividend income is recognized when the Company’s right to receive dividend is established by the reporting date.
4. Royalty and Technology Development fees: Royalty and Technology development fees income are accounted for as per the terms of contracts.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2016

v) Translation of integral and non-integral straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated foreign operation The Company classifies all its foreign operations as either “integral foreign operations” or “non-integral foreign operations.”

The financial statements of an integral foreign operation are translated as if the transactions of the foreign operation have been those of the Company itself.

The assets and liabilities of a non-integral foreign operation are translated into the reporting currency at the exchange rate prevailing at the reporting date. Their Statement of Profit and Loss are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the dates of transactions or weighted average weekly rates, where such rates approximate the exchange rate at the date of transaction. The exchange differences arising on translation are accumulated in the foreign currency translation reserve. On disposal of a non-integral foreign operation, the accumulated foreign currency translation reserve relating to that foreign operation is recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

When there is a change in the classification of a foreign operation, the translation procedures applicable to the revised classification are applied from the date of the change in the classification.

L) Leases

Where the Company is lessee Finance leases, which effectively transfer to the Company substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are capitalized at the inception of the lease term at the lower of the fair value of the leased property and present value of minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are recognized as finance costs in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Lease management fees, legal charges and other initial direct costs of lease are capitalized.

A leased asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the asset. However, if there is no reasonable certainty that the Company will obtain the ownership by the end of the lease term, the capitalized asset is depreciated on a basis over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term whichever is earlier.

M) Research and Development

Research costs are expensed as incurred. Development expenditure incurred on individual projects is recognized as an intangible asset when the Company can demonstrate all the following:-

- The technical feasibility of completing the intangible assets so that it will be available for use or sale.
- Its intention to complete the asset.
- Its ability to use or sell the asset.
- How the asset will generate the future economic benefits.
- The availability of adequate resources to complete the development and to use or sell the asset.
- The ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during development.

N) Employee Benefits

i) Defined Contribution plan Retirement benefits in the form of provident fund, Superannuation, Employees State Insurance Contribution and Labour Welfare Fund are defined contribution schemes. The Company has no obligation, other than the contribution payable to these funds / schemes. The Company recognizes contribution payable to these funds / schemes as expenditure, when an employee renders the related service. If the contribution payable to these funds / schemes for service received before the Balance Sheet date exceeds the contribution already paid, the deficit payable to the funds / schemes are recognized as a liability after deducting the contribution already paid. If the contribution already paid exceeds the contribution due for services received before the Balance Sheet date, then excess is recognized as an asset to the extent that the prepayment will lead to, for example, a reduction in future payment or a cash refund.

# CEAT Annual Financial Report

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

for the year ended March 31, 2016

## Defined Benefit Plan

Actuarial gains/losses are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which they occur.

## Compensated Absences

d. Demands and disputes considered as “Remote” by the Company

1. The Company has been served with a Show Cause cum Demand Notice from the DGCEI (Directorate General of Central Excise Intelligence) Mumbai, on the ground that, the activity of making tyre set, i.e. inserting Tubes and Flaps inside the Tyres and tied up through Polypropylene Straps, amounts to manufacture / pre-packaged commodity under Section 2(f)(iii) of Central Excise Act, read with Section 2(l) of the Legal Metrology Act, 2009. Accordingly, the authorities worked out the differential duty amounting to ` 8,417.79 Lacs i.e., the amount of duty already paid on the basis of transaction value and duty payable on the basis of MRP under Section 4A, for the period from April-2011 to March-2015. The Company believes that Set of TT / TTF (Tyre and Tube / Tyre, Tube and Flap) is not pre-packaged commodity in terms of provisions of Legal Metrology Act, 2009. The Company has a strong case on the ground that, the said issue has been clarified by the Controller of the Legal Metrology Department vide its letter dated May 1, 1991 that “Tyre with tube & flaps tied with three thin polythene strips may not be treated as a pre-packed commodity within the meaning of rule 2(l) of the Standards of Weights and

Measures (Packaged Commodities), Rules, 1977”. The above clarification has been re-affirmed vide letter dated November 16, 1992 by the Legal Metrology authorities.

The Competition Commission of India (CCI) had, while considering the representation made by All India Tyres Dealers Federation (AITDF) made a prima facie view that the major players of tyre industry (including the Company) had some understanding amongst themselves, especially in the replacement market, as they did not pass the benefit of corresponding reduction in prices of major raw material inputs for the period subsequent to the year 2011-12. According to CCI, this practice is in violation of the Competition Act 2002 (the Act). Therefore, CCI had, vide its order passed on June 24, 2014 under Section 26(1) of the Act, directed the Office of the Director General (DG) to investigate the said alleged violation of the Act. DG submitted its Investigation Report to CCI in December 2015, based on which CCI passed an order on February 18, 2016 directing the said tyre manufacturers to file their suggestions/objections by May 5, 2016. The Company’s decision to change the price is purely a business decision which depends upon many factors like cost of production, brand value perception and profit margin of each product, quality perception of each product in the market, demand and supply situation of each product category and market potential and market shares targets of various product categories etc. In view of the above, Company believes that it has a strong case.

The Board of Directors have declared an interim dividend of `11.50 per share pursuant to which, the total amount to be distributed as dividend is `4,651.76 Lacs (Previous year final dividend of `10 per share, amounting to `4,045.01 Lacs).
